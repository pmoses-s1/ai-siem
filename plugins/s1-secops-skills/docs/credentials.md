# Credentials

This is the canonical credentials reference for every install path (Docker quick start, npx/uvx, and team VM). It covers every key, where to find each one, the two token types, and the resolution order. The ready-to-paste `claude_desktop_config.json` block lives with each install path: follow your path in the [README Installation section](../README.md#installation) and fill in the keys documented here.

## credentials.json keys

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_URL":       "https://usea1-yourorg.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "eyJ...your-api-token...",
  "S1_HEC_INGEST_URL":    "https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_HEC_TOKEN":         "<SDL Log Write Key, optional; hec_ingest needs it>"
}
```

| Key | Required for | How to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `S1_CONSOLE_URL` | Everything | Your console URL, e.g. `https://usea1-acme.sentinelone.net`. No trailing slash. |
| `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` | Mgmt Console REST, PowerQuery LRQ, UAM GraphQL, Purple AI GraphQL, SDL config ops (Management Z SP5+) | Settings → Users → Service Users → Create Service User → copy the API token. |
| `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` | UAM alert/indicator ingest, SDL log ingest | Region-specific HEC host, e.g. `https://ingest.us1.sentinelone.net`. Look up yours at [SentinelOne Endpoint URLs by Region](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000004961). |
| `S1_HEC_TOKEN` | Raw log ingest over the event collector (`hec_ingest`) only | An **SDL Log Write Key**, minted per account or site: Console → Singularity Data Lake → API Keys → Log Write Key. Optional to set, but **`hec_ingest` now needs it**: the collector no longer accepts the console API token. |

`S1_CONSOLE_URL` and `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` are the minimum required, and between them they authorise every SDL operation including parser and dashboard deployment. Add `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` only when you need HEC log or alert ingest, and `S1_HEC_TOKEN` when that includes **raw log** ingest.

The two ingest paths do not share a credential. UAM alert ingest (`POST /v1/alerts`) authenticates with `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` and requires an `S1-Scope` header. Raw log ingest over the event collector requires `S1_HEC_TOKEN`, an SDL Log Write Key, and sends **no** scope header, because the key is minted against a fixed account or site. The collector rejects the console token outright. The scoped SDL keys (`SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY`, `SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY`, `SDL_LOG_READ_KEY`, `SDL_LOG_WRITE_KEY`, `SDL_XDR_URL`) are retired and are no longer read.

```python
```

## Token types

The S1 API has two token types and they are not interchangeable for all operations:

| Token type | Created via | Visible in UI | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Service User token | Settings → Users → Service Users | No: workflows/rules created with this token are invisible to human users in the UI | Use for programmatic API access |
| Personal Console User token | Settings → Users → My User → API Token | Yes: objects created are visible and attributed to the user | Required for Hyperautomation workflows to appear in the UI |

For most skills, a service user token is correct. If you need Hyperautomation workflows to be visible and editable in the console UI, use a personal console user token.

**Multi-scope tokens:** Some endpoints reject service user tokens scoped to more than one account with `HTTP 403 code 4030010`. Affected endpoints include `/threat-intelligence/iocs`. Use a single-scope token for those operations by adding:

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN_SINGLE_SCOPE": "eyJ...your-single-scope-token..."
}
```

The skills auto-detect and fall back to this key when the primary token is rejected.

---

## Resolution order

Credentials are resolved in this priority order (highest wins):

1. Environment variables (`S1_CONSOLE_URL`, `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL`)
2. `credentials.json` in the Cowork project folder (auto-discovered by the plugin's SessionStart hook, and by s1-secops-mcp walking up the directory tree)
3. `~/.config/sentinelone/credentials.json` (fallback for terminal/Claude Code sessions)

---

## Setting up credentials.json (Cowork)

The full key list and resolution order are in the tables above. For the file-based fallback (direct skill use without `s1-secops-mcp`), create `credentials.json` in your Cowork project folder with the keys you need:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
PROJECT_DIR=~/Documents/Claude/Projects/MyProject
cat > "$PROJECT_DIR/credentials.json" <<'JSON'
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_URL": "https://<your-tenant>.sentinelone.net",
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "<your-mgmt-console-api-token>"
}
JSON
${EDITOR:-nano} "$PROJECT_DIR/credentials.json"
```

Add `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` alongside these if you need HEC ingest (full list in the [keys table](#credentialsjson-keys) above).

When creating the project in Cowork, add `credentials.json` and `CLAUDE.md` under **Add files** so Claude has access to both in every session.

## Configuring the MCP servers

The MCP servers receive these credentials as environment variables in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows). The ready-to-paste config block differs by install path, so copy it from the path you are following rather than duplicating it here:

- **Docker (recommended):** [README → Quick start (Docker), Step 2](../README.md#1-quick-start-docker)
- **npx/uvx (host runtime):** [docs/installation.md → Step 1: Configure MCP servers](./installation.md#step-1-configure-mcp-servers)
- **Team VM (shared server):** [docs/vm-deployment.md](./vm-deployment.md)

Whichever block you paste, fill in the same keys from the tables above. Two things apply to every path:

> **Threat intel MCP:** Replace `virustotal` with your organisation's approved threat intelligence MCP if different. Any MCP that provides file hash, IP, domain, and URL lookup tools works. The CLAUDE.md operating instructions require multi-source confirmation before a TRUE POSITIVE or CRITICAL verdict: they do not mandate a specific provider.

**Host-runtime prerequisites (npx/uvx path only, not needed for Docker):**
- Node.js 18+ for `s1-secops-mcp` and `@burtthecoder/mcp-virustotal` via `npx` (`node --version`)
- `uv` for `purple-mcp`: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`, then open a new terminal and run `uvx --version`
- A VirusTotal API key (free tier is fine) from [virustotal.com](https://virustotal.com)

Restart Claude Desktop after editing the config. All servers then appear under connected MCP tools.

## Verifying credentials work

After setup, run the quick test:

```bash
cd ai-siem/plugins/s1-secops-skills/skills/mgmt-console-api
pip install requests
python scripts/s1_client.py
```

This prints the first 5 accounts and runs 4 parallel GETs to confirm auth and connectivity.

To run a full non-destructive sweep of every readable endpoint:

```bash
python scripts/smoke_test_queries.py --workers 12
```

Results land in `references/tenant_capabilities.{json,md}`.
