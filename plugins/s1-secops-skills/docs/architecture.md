# Architecture

This document explains how the layers of the SentinelOne AI analyst stack fit together, top-down: the CLAUDE.md operating instructions that drive every session, the umbrella sdl-solutions skill that orchestrates whole-solution deploys, the primitive Claude skills, and the MCP servers that reach the live APIs.

---

## The layers

The stack runs top-down: CLAUDE.md decides what to do and invokes skills; the umbrella
`sdl-solutions` skill orchestrates the primitive skills for whole-solution work; the skills reach the
live APIs through the MCP servers.

```
CLAUDE.md                       Main instruction layer: SOC Analyst persona, session protocol,
                                evidence rules, investigation workflow, classification gates.
                                Loaded as a resource via s1-secops-mcp at session start. Decides what
                                to do and invokes skills as needed.

```

## How the layers interact

### CLAUDE.md

`CLAUDE.md` defines the operating persona for every session: Principal SOC Analyst. It contains:

- Mandatory session initialization protocol (enumerate SDL sources, triage alerts in parallel)
- Evidence discipline rules (no fabrication, cite sources inline, mark assumptions explicitly)
- Investigation workflow (triage, enrichment, correlation, MITRE mapping, risk scoring)
- Alert classification rules (no CRITICAL verdict without independent threat intel confirmation)
- Anomaly detection checklist (frequency, timing, geolocation, privilege, chain anomalies)

`s1-secops-mcp` exposes `CLAUDE.md` as an MCP resource (`sentinelone://soc-context`) and prompt (`soc_analyst`). Claude reads it at session start. The file lives in `claude-skills/CLAUDE.md`; editing it and restarting the MCP server immediately changes Claude's operating behaviour.

### s1-secops-mcp

A local Node.js process that runs outside the Cowork sandbox. Because the Cowork sandbox proxy blocks outbound HTTPS to `*.sentinelone.net` by default, all API calls go through this server instead, bypassing the sandbox proxy entirely.

It exposes 26 MCP tools across five groups:

| Group | Tools | API surface |
|---|---|---|
| PowerQuery | `powerquery_enumerate_sources`, `powerquery_run`, `powerquery_schema_discover` | SDL LRQ API |
| Mgmt Console | `s1_api_get`, `s1_api_post`, `s1_api_put`, `s1_api_patch`, `s1_api_delete` | S1 REST API v2.1 |
| UAM | `uam_list_alerts`, `uam_get_alert`, `uam_add_note`, `uam_set_status`, `uam_ingest_alert`, `uam_post_alert`, `uam_available_actions`, `purple_ai_alert_summary` | UAM GraphQL + HEC ingest |
| SDL | `sdl_list_files`, `sdl_get_file`, `sdl_put_file`, `sdl_delete_file`, `hec_ingest` | SDL config + HEC log ingest API |
| Hyperautomation | `ha_list_workflows`, `ha_get_workflow`, `ha_import_workflow`, `ha_export_workflow`, `ha_delete_workflow` | HA public + v1 API |

Full tool reference: [mcp-tools.md](./mcp-tools.md)

### purple-mcp

A separate MCP server (Python, fetched from GitHub via `uvx`) that provides the Purple AI investigation surface. It covers:

- `purple_ai`: natural-language queries against SDL telemetry
- `powerquery`: run raw PowerQuery strings via the SDL LRQ engine
- `list_alerts`, `search_alerts`, `get_alert`, `get_alert_history`, `get_alert_notes`: UAM alert access
- `list_inventory_items`, `search_inventory_items`, `get_inventory_item`: asset inventory
- `list_vulnerabilities`, `get_vulnerability`: CVE and patch gap reporting
- `list_misconfigurations`, `get_misconfiguration`: agent config hygiene
- `uam_add_note`, `uam_set_status`: alert annotation and triage

purple-mcp is complementary to s1-secops-mcp. They share credentials but serve different roles:

| Task | Use |
|---|---|
| SDL PowerQuery hunting | Either: `powerquery_run` (s1-secops-mcp) or `powerquery` (purple-mcp) |
| Natural-language Purple AI queries | purple-mcp `purple_ai` only |
| Alert triage, notes, status | purple-mcp is preferred (richer GraphQL fields); s1-secops-mcp UAM tools as fallback |
| Management Console REST ops (agents, threats, sites, exclusions, IOCs, detection rules) | s1-secops-mcp `s1_api_*` only |
| SDL log ingest, parser/dashboard deploy | s1-secops-mcp SDL tools only |
| Hyperautomation workflow import | s1-secops-mcp HA tools only |

### Skills (SKILL.md files)

Each skill folder contains a `SKILL.md` that Claude reads when a relevant request triggers the skill. SKILL.md files encode:

- API endpoint paths and required field schemas (confirmed against live API, not just swagger)
- Non-obvious requirements, gotchas, and field-name traps discovered by testing
- Python script reference for running operations locally
- MCP tool guidance (which tool to use for which operation)

The skills are read-only procedural knowledge. They do not execute API calls directly when loaded: they instruct Claude on *how* to use the MCP tools and scripts to execute operations correctly.

`sdl-solutions` is the umbrella skill in this layer: for a whole-solution request (onboard a source, asset enrichment, UEBA, ingest health monitoring, or custom detection exclusions) it runs first, collects parameters, previews, and orchestrates the primitive skills in dependency order, instead of each skill being invoked independently.

## Authentication flow

All four API surfaces use a single service user token (`S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`), including every SDL read and write operation.

```
S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN  ──► S1 Mgmt REST API    (Authorization: ApiToken <jwt>)
                      ──► SDL config ops       (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>)
                      ──► UAM GraphQL          (Authorization: ApiToken <jwt>)
                      ──► Purple AI GraphQL    (Authorization: ApiToken <jwt>)
                      ──► LRQ PowerQuery       (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>)
                      ──► HEC log ingest       (Authorization: Bearer <jwt>, host S1_HEC_INGEST_URL)

S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN  ──► SDL putFile          (Authorization: Bearer <token>)
```

`S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` authorises every SDL operation, config read, config write and log read, and is also the Bearer used for HEC log ingest.

Credential resolution order (highest priority first):

1. Environment variables (`S1_CONSOLE_URL`, `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, `SDL_*`)
2. `credentials.json` in the Cowork project folder (auto-discovered by the plugin's SessionStart hook)
3. `~/.config/sentinelone/credentials.json` (terminal fallback)

For the MCP servers, credentials are passed via `env` in `claude_desktop_config.json`: see [credentials.md](./credentials.md).

## Sandbox proxy and why MCP is needed

The Cowork sandbox runs API calls through a proxy that blocks outbound HTTPS to arbitrary domains including `*.sentinelone.net`. There are two solutions:

**Option A (recommended): s1-secops-mcp local server.** Runs as a local process on your machine, outside the sandbox. API calls go directly from your machine to SentinelOne. No allowlist changes needed.

**Option B: Network allowlist.** In Claude Desktop settings, add `*.sentinelone.net` to the allowed domains. This lets the skills' Python scripts (`s1_client.py`, `sdl_client.py`) reach the API from inside the sandbox. No MCP server needed, but requires admin configuration.

Most users should use Option A.
