# MCP Tools Reference

Full reference for all tools exposed by `s1-secops-mcp` and `purple-mcp`. For architecture context see [architecture.md](./architecture.md).

---

## s1-secops-mcp

Runs as a local Node.js process. Source: `s1-secops-mcp/index.js`. Install via `claude_desktop_config.json`: see [credentials.md](./credentials.md).

### PowerQuery tools

**`powerquery_enumerate_sources`**
Lists every `dataSource.name` active in SDL over the last 24 hours. Run this at the start of every session: never assume which sources are present. Returns unique source names, vendors, and categories.

**`powerquery_run`**
Executes a PowerQuery string via the SDL Long-Running Query (LRQ) API. Polls until results are ready. Returns tabular results. Use for threat hunting, baseline queries, custom detection rule validation, and any SDL telemetry question.

**`powerquery_schema_discover`**
Runs a V1 `query` (full-event JSON) against a specific `dataSource.name` to return field names and sample values. Use this before writing any query against a source: field names drift between sessions due to parser edits and reserved-field rewrites. Returns a dict of `{field_name: [sample_values]}`.

### Management Console REST tools

These five tools are generic REST wrappers over the S1 Management Console API v2.1 (781 operations, 113 tags). The path always starts with `/web/api/v2.1/`.

**`s1_api_get`**
Read any resource: agents, threats, sites, alerts, detection rules, exclusions, IOCs, accounts, groups, policies, and more. Supports all query parameters as a `params` dict. Example: `GET /web/api/v2.1/agents?limit=20&siteIds=123`.

**`s1_api_post`**
Create or action: create IOC, create detection rule, isolate endpoint, add exclusion, create Hyperautomation workflow, etc. Body is passed as-is: the tool does not auto-wrap in `{"data": {...}}`. Check the swagger or SKILL.md for the correct envelope per endpoint.

**`s1_api_put`**
Full-replace update: update detection rule, update policy, update exclusion. Requires all mandatory fields: omitting required fields returns 400.

**`s1_api_patch`**
Partial update: used for endpoints that support PATCH (fewer than PUT). Rare in the S1 API.

**`s1_api_delete`**
Delete with filter body: delete IOCs, detection rules, exclusions. Many S1 DELETE endpoints accept a filter body (e.g. `{"filter": {"ids": [...]}}`). Pass it as the `body` param.

Reference: `mgmt-console-api/SKILL.md` for confirmed body schemas and required fields per endpoint surface.

### UAM tools

**`uam_list_alerts`**
List UAM alerts via GraphQL. Filter with individual convenience params, not a single filter string: `status` (valid values `NEW`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `RESOLVED` only; there is no `OPEN`, which silently returns 0 results), `severity` (e.g. `CRITICAL`), `detectionProduct` (e.g. `EDR`), `searchText`, plus `startTime`/`endTime` for a time window and `first`/`after` for pagination. Returns UUID-based alert objects with full context.

**`uam_get_alert`**
Fetch a single UAM alert by UUID. Returns full alert detail including raw indicators, assets, threat info, analyst notes, and history.

**`uam_add_note`**
Add a text note to an alert. Appears in the alert's notes history.

**`uam_set_status`**
Set alert status. Valid values: `NEW`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `RESOLVED`. To mark an alert as a false positive, add a note via `uam_add_note` explaining why and set status to `RESOLVED`. Verdict (`analystVerdict`) is a separate field on the alert; this tool does not change it.

**`purple_ai_alert_summary`**
Generate a Purple AI natural-language summary for a specific UAM alert. Pass the alert's OCSF JSON (as returned by `uam_get_alert`) and receive a `{ token, summary }` result that's identical to what the Purple AI card surfaces in the console alert detail. Synchronous; no polling.

**`uam_ingest_alert`**
Ingest a synthetic alert via the UAM Alert Interface (HEC). For creating test/synthetic alerts. Requires `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` and `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`.

**`uam_post_alert`**
Post an OCSF-formatted alert to the HEC ingest endpoint.

**`uam_available_actions`**
List the actions this caller may trigger on an alert, with `isDisabled` and `disabledReason` per action. Availability is filtered by the caller's permissions and by the alert type, so query this before concluding that a write is impossible.

Indicators are no longer posted separately: `/v1/indicators` is unreachable, so they are created inline with the alert in a single `POST /v1/alerts` (see `uam_post_alert`).

### SDL tools

**`sdl_list_files`**
List configuration files on the SDL tenant (parsers, dashboards, lookups, datatables) via `POST <console>/sdl/v2/graphql`. Returns each file's `name`, `version` and `udoId`. Optional `pathPrefix` scopes the listing, e.g. `/logParsers/` or `/dashboards/`, so a caller does not have to pull all 2,264 files into context.

**`sdl_get_file`**
Download the content of a single SDL configuration file. Address it by `path` for name-addressed namespaces (`/logParsers/`, `/lookups/`, `/datatables/`, `/automaticLookups`) or by `udoId` for a dashboard. The console's Configuration Files grid displays a dashboard as `/dashboards/id/<udoId>/<name>`; that is a display string, not a path. Pass the number as `udoId` and the file's real name is `/dashboards/<name>`.

**`sdl_put_file`**
Upload or update a configuration file on SDL. Used for deploying parsers and dashboards. Takes `path` or `udoId`, plus optional `expectedVersion`, which is enforced on both address forms. A path-addressed write to an existing dashboard is refused, because `addConfigFile(name:)` creates a duplicate rather than updating in place; the tool names the `udoId`s already holding that name. Create a dashboard by name once, then address it by `udoId`. Authorised by `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`.

**`sdl_delete_file`**
Delete a configuration file from SDL by `path` or `udoId`. The tool verifies removal by re-reading and returns `{status, deleted, raw}`.

**`hec_ingest`**
Ingest raw logs/events into SDL via the HEC (HTTP Event Collector) endpoint. Applies a named parser via `?sourcetype` and lands the data for Event Search, PowerQuery, and detection rules. Posts to `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` with `Authorization: Bearer <S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN>`; the `S1-Scope` header (accountId or accountId:siteId) is required. Replaces the removed `sdl_upload_logs`. Used for ingesting custom telemetry or test events during parser development.

When ingesting pre-structured / OCSF JSON with `?isParsed=true` (no parser), every event MUST also include the SentinelOne source-attribution fields `dataSource.name`, `dataSource.vendor`, `dataSource.category` (set to `security`; other categories ingest but do not process correctly for custom OCSF sources), `event.type`, and `site_id`. OCSF does not define these; without them events land with a null source (no attribution, degraded console rendering, and any `dataSource.name`-based filter or detection will not match). Emit `event.type` as a FLAT dotted key (e.g. `"event.type": "DNS Activity"`); a nested `event:{...}` object is silently dropped because `event` is a HEC-reserved key.

All SDL tools take an optional `scope` argument, `"<accountId>"` or `"<accountId>:<siteId>"`, sent as the `S1-Scope` header. **Reads are scope-FILTERED, not merely scope-tagged**: measured live on one tenant, the same dashboard listing returned 1,515 at account scope and 7 at a single site scope. An object created at site scope is invisible to an account-scoped listing, so every "not found" is scope-relative. `scope` falls back to `S1_SCOPE` in credentials and omitting it uses the token default.

### SDL dashboard lifecycle tools

These run on the `dashboardsV2` GraphQL surface, the one the console itself drives. It is dashboard-aware where the config-file tools above are not: it carries name, description, tabs, sharing and authorship. A dashboard's `id` here is the same value as its `udoId` in `sdl_list_files`.

**`sdl_list_dashboards`**
List dashboards visible at a scope with `{id, name, description, configType, access:{public, users, owner}}`. Prefer this over `sdl_list_files` when you need the owner or sharing state; prefer `sdl_list_files` when you need the numeric version for optimistic locking.

**`sdl_get_dashboard`**
Read one dashboard including its tabs, by `id` (preferred) or `name`. Note `tabs[].graphs`, `.parameters`, `.filters` and `.options` come back as JSON **strings**, not objects. The `version` field here is a display string and is usually empty; it is NOT the optimistic-locking token, use `sdl_get_file` for that.

**`sdl_create_dashboard`**
Create a dashboard from a complete dashboard-JSON document passed as one `config` string. This is the preferred deploy path: it takes the whole document (`configType`, `duration`, `description`, `tabs[]`) in one call, and it validates the JSON before sending, which avoids the console editor's stub-append failure (`{graphs: []}{...}` yields `Content is invalid json / Additional text after JSON object` and leaves an empty dashboard behind). `isPublic` defaults to **true**, diverging from the raw API's false: `access.owner` is the calling identity, so with a service-account token a private dashboard is readable through the API but invisible in the console to a human at any scope, which is indistinguishable from a failed deploy. Names reject `( ) [ ] { } : , & ' % #` with only `Invalid name` as the error; letters, digits, space, `-`, `_`, `.` and `/` are accepted.

**`sdl_share_dashboard`**
Share or unshare a dashboard to scopes and/or users via `shareResource`. This is the **only** SDL operation that takes an explicit scope target; every other operation infers scope from the request header. Use it to push an account-scoped dashboard down to a specific site without recreating it. Note the two different scope arguments: the `scopes` array is where the dashboard goes, while `scope` is the header for the call itself.

**`sdl_save_dashboard_layout`**
Replace the panel layout of one tab. `graphs` is a JSON string shaped `{"graphs":[...]}`, including the wrapper key, even though the response echoes a bare array. Use for incremental panel edits; use `sdl_create_dashboard` for a whole new document.

**`sdl_delete_dashboard`**
Delete a dashboard by `id` or `name`. The mutation returns a bare boolean, so the tool re-reads afterwards and only reports success once removal is confirmed.

### Hyperautomation tools

**`ha_list_workflows`**
List Hyperautomation workflows on the tenant. Supports scope, sort, and pagination. Returns each workflow's `id`, `name`, `state`, `status`, `revisionId`, and action list.

**`ha_get_workflow`**
Fetch a single workflow by `workflowId` and optional `revisionId`. Auto-resolves `revisionId` from the list if omitted.

**`ha_import_workflow`**
Import a workflow JSON into the tenant. Requires `Hyper Automate.write` permission. Creates the workflow in draft state. Response uses `id` (not `workflowId`) and `version_id` (not `versionId`).

**`ha_export_workflow`**
Export all workflows as a ZIP archive.

**`ha_delete_workflow`**
Delete one or more workflows via `DELETE /workflows/{id}` (soft, recoverable). Scope with `accountIds` or `siteIds` to match where the workflow lives. Requires Hyper Automate.write permission.

## purple-mcp

Fetched automatically from GitHub via `uvx` on first launch. Source: `github.com/Sentinel-One/purple-mcp`. No local install needed.

### Alert tools

**`list_alerts`**
List UAM alerts with rich filter support (status, severity, detection product, date range). Returns paginated alert summaries.

**`search_alerts`**
Text-search across alerts. Returns matching alerts with relevance context.

**`get_alert`**
Full alert detail: indicators, assets, threat info, agent, analyst notes, history.

**`get_alert_history`**
Audit log of all status and verdict changes for an alert.

**`get_alert_notes`**
All analyst notes added to an alert (includes MDR closure notes and analyst verdicts).

**`uam_add_note`** / **`uam_set_status`**
Alert annotation and triage (purple-mcp versions; prefer these over s1-secops-mcp equivalents for richer field access).

### Asset and inventory tools

**`list_inventory_items`** / **`search_inventory_items`** / **`get_inventory_item`**
Agent inventory: OS, version, network interfaces, groups, policy, last-seen, agent UUID. Use `get_inventory_item(agent_uuid)` to get asset criticality context during alert triage.

### Vulnerability tools

**`list_vulnerabilities`** / **`get_vulnerability`** / **`get_vulnerability_history`** / **`get_vulnerability_notes`**
CVE and patch gap data per agent. Filter by severity, exploitability, CVE ID.

### Misconfiguration tools

**`list_misconfigurations`** / **`get_misconfiguration`** / **`get_misconfiguration_history`** / **`get_misconfiguration_notes`**
Agent configuration hygiene findings (missing EDR, outdated agent, policy gaps).

### Purple AI tools

**`purple_ai`**
Natural-language query against SDL telemetry. Sends the question to the Purple AI LLM, which returns a PowerQuery string plus an English summary. Claude then executes the returned query via `powerquery_run`. Requires Purple AI tenant entitlement.

**`powerquery`**
Run a raw PowerQuery string via the SDL LRQ engine (purple-mcp version). Equivalent to s1-secops-mcp `powerquery_run`.

### Timestamp tools

**`get_timestamp_range`**
Convert human-readable time ranges ("last 7 days", "yesterday") to epoch milliseconds for use in queries.

**`iso_to_unix_timestamp`**
Convert ISO 8601 timestamps to Unix milliseconds.
