# Playbook: Risk-Based Alerting (RBA)

Implement the Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) paradigm in SentinelOne SDL. Instead of alerting on every noisy-but-interesting observation, each observation is published as a low-noise **risk event** into a dedicated risk index. Risk accumulates per **risk object** (user or host), amplified by **risk factors** (asset criticality, privileged, watchlist). A single high-fidelity alert fires only when a risk object crosses a cumulative-score or distinct-MITRE-tactic threshold. The analyst gets a contextualised story (a timeline of contributing events across tactics), not a flood of disconnected alerts.

Every mechanic in this playbook is tenant-validated end to end (2026-06-24/25): risk index, contributors, factor multipliers, collector flow, incident rules, dashboard, and a real fired alert.

> **Two RBA approaches, pick per need.** This playbook is the heavyweight **risk-index** model: a
> dedicated `risk` index populated by a collector flow from contributor PowerQueries, with
> asset-derived risk factors and four incident rules. A lightweight alternative ships in the UEBA
> solution (the s1-ueba-deployer, see `ueba-anomaly-detection.md`): it scores the existing SentinelOne
> **alert stream** in place against an editable RiskWeights + AssetWatchlist datatable and fires one
> Hyperautomation watchdog per entity, with no separate index or collector. Use the risk-index model
> to score arbitrary contributor queries into asset-weighted, multi-tactic risk objects; use the
> alert-stream model to consolidate the alerts you already have into one cumulative per-entity score.

## Concept mapping: RBA concepts to SentinelOne

| RBA concept | SentinelOne |
|---|---|
| Risk index | Custom SDL data source `dataSource.name='risk'`, populated via SDL HTTP ingest (`POST /services/collector/event?isParsed=true`) |
| Risk Analysis adaptive response (write a risk event, do not alert) | Risk collector: a scheduled Hyperautomation flow that runs contributor PowerQueries and publishes the resulting risk events |
| Risk object (user / system) | `risk_object` + `risk_object_type` ('user' or 'host'); source fields `src.process.user` / `actor.user.name` (user), `endpoint.name` / `agent.uuid` (host) |
| Threat object (cmdline, hash, account) | `threat_object` + `threat_object_type` on the risk event |
| MITRE annotation | `mitre_tactic` + `mitre_technique` on the risk event |
| Base risk score | `base_score` per contributor |
| Risk factors (multipliers) | A factor lookup keyed by object, sourced from the Asset Inventory (criticality / privileged / riskFactors); `risk_score = base_score * multiplier` |
| Risk incident rule | A STAR scheduled PowerQuery rule over `dataSource.name='risk'`: sum score and count distinct tactics per `risk_object`, fire over threshold |
| Notable with timeline | The incident alert (entity-bound to the risk object) plus the dashboard's per-object timeline of contributing risk events |
| Risk Factor Editor | The `{{PREFIX}}RiskFactors.csv` factor table the analyst edits |

## Architecture / data flow

1. **Risk model config (contributors).** A set of contributor definitions (`assets/rba_contributors.json`): each is `{ name, powerquery, base_score, mitre_tactic, mitre_technique, risk_object field, risk_object_type, threat_object field }`. Each contributor PQ ends in a `| columns` projection emitting the risk-event schema.
2. **Risk collector (scheduled HA flow).** Runs each contributor via the synchronous SDL PowerQuery endpoint, maps result rows to named objects (`MAP_TABLE`), applies the risk-factor multiplier (a `| lookup` against the factor table inside the contributor PQ), shapes them to NDJSON risk events (JQ `tojson`), and publishes them into `dataSource.name='risk'`. Runs hourly.
3. **Risk factors.** A CSV factor table (`{{PREFIX}}RiskFactors.csv`) keyed by object value, holding `risk_multiplier` + `reason`. Built/refreshed from the Asset Inventory (`| datasource assets from 'surface/endpoint'` / `'surface/identity'`); analysts can hand-edit it (the "Risk Factor Editor").
4. **Risk incident rules (STAR scheduled, over `risk`).** Four rules: per user and per host, each with a 24h cumulative-score rule and a 7d distinct-MITRE-tactic rule (catches fast and "low and slow"). Each emits one row per risk object with `entityMappings` binding the object, and carries score / tactic / technique / contributor counts + first/last seen + top message.
5. **Dashboard.** Risk leaderboard, risk-events count, score over time by object type, MITRE tactic and contributor breakdowns, top threat objects, and the contributing-events timeline.
6. **Response (optional).** A Hyperautomation flow off the incident alert (reuse the onboarding `threat_response_workflow.template.json` pattern, VirusTotal-gated containment).

## Step 0: intake (ask only what the prompt leaves out)

1. **Risk objects** (default both): user, host, or both. Both deploys two parallel incident-rule tracks.
2. **Contributors** (default: ship the starter set in `rba_contributors.json`). Each is a noisy-but-interesting behaviour with a base score and MITRE tag. The analyst can add/remove.
3. **Risk factors** (default: reuse asset enrichment): pull criticality / privileged / watchlist from the Asset Inventory, plus an optional static-override CSV.
4. **Thresholds** (defaults): user 24h cumulative score >= 50, host >= 40; user 7d distinct tactics >= 4, host >= 3. Base scores 10 to 25 per contributor; factor multipliers 1 to 3.
5. **Scope** (default account): `accountIds` or a resolved `siteIds`.
6. **Collector cadence** (default hourly): `runIntervalMinutes` 60 and the contributor PQ `startTime` matched to it (last 1h).

## Step 1: risk index

HEC (HTTP Event Collector) is SentinelOne's HTTP event-ingest endpoint; the risk index is a custom SDL data source written through it.

**Credential: the collector takes an SDL Log Write Key, not the console API token.** Measured on a live tenant: `/services/collector/event` and `/services/collector/raw` accept `Authorization: Bearer <SDL Log Write Key>` and return `HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}`. The console API token is refused with `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}`. Send **no** `S1-Scope` header: the Log Write Key is minted for one account or site and writes only there, so the ingest scope cannot be overridden and the header has no effect. Mint the key in the console (Singularity Data Lake, API keys, Log Write Key) for the account or site the risk index should live in, and export it as `S1_HEC_TOKEN`.

The risk index is created implicitly on first publish: ingest one sample risk event to materialise it, then confirm it queries back:

```json
POST {{HEC_INGEST_URL}}/services/collector/event?isParsed=true
Authorization: Bearer <SDL Log Write Key>

{"dataSource.name":"risk","dataSource.vendor":"S1-RBA","dataSource.category":"security","risk_object":"<obj>","risk_object_type":"user","base_score":10,"risk_score":10,"mitre_tactic":"Execution","mitre_technique":"T1059.001","threat_object":"<cmdline>","threat_object_type":"command_line","contributor":"<name>","risk_message":"<desc>"}
```

Same call as curl:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "${HEC_INGEST_URL}/services/collector/event?isParsed=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${S1_HEC_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"dataSource.name":"risk","dataSource.vendor":"S1-RBA","dataSource.category":"security","risk_object":"<obj>","risk_object_type":"user","base_score":10,"risk_score":10,"mitre_tactic":"Execution","mitre_technique":"T1059.001","threat_object":"<cmdline>","threat_object_type":"command_line","contributor":"<name>","risk_message":"<desc>"}'
```

`isParsed=true` indexes the JSON keys directly (no parser). The dotted `dataSource.name` key makes it land as the `risk` source. Confirm:

```text
dataSource.name='risk' risk_object=* | group events=count(), score=sum(number(risk_score)), tactics=estimate_distinct(mitre_tactic) by risk_object, risk_object_type | sort -score | limit 25
```

`number(risk_score)` is mandatory (SDL columns can be string-typed; see the numeric-cast rule).

## Step 2: factor table

Write `{{PREFIX}}RiskFactors.csv` to `/datatables/`. Header `factor_key,factor_type,risk_multiplier,reason`. Build it from the Asset Inventory (criticality / privileged / riskFactors) plus optional hand-edited overrides. The contributor PQ joins it:

```text
| lookup mult=risk_multiplier from {{PREFIX}}RiskFactors.csv by factor_key =:anycase risk_object
| let risk_score = base_score * (mult ? number(mult) : 1)
```

`mult ? number(mult) : 1` is the bare-field coalesce (no `coalesce()` in PQ); unmatched objects keep multiplier 1. `=:anycase` matches case-insensitively. Validated: a privileged user (x2) amplified base 15 to risk_score 30.

### Risk factors from AD objects (ISPM)

This is the SentinelOne equivalent of Splunk RBA "importing customer assets via AD objects." If the customer has **ISPM (Identity Security Posture Management / Ranger AD)**, Active Directory objects sync into the Asset Inventory **identity surface**, so the factor table is built directly from AD, no manual CSV. Confirmed live (2026-06-25): identity assets carry `activeCoverage: ["ISPM"]`, `assetEnvironment: "Active Directory"`, and per-object AD attributes `privileged` (bool), `adminCount` (number), `serviceAccount` (bool), `memberOf` (group DNs), `distinguishedName` (OU), `objectSid`, `principalName` / `samAccountName`, and `riskFactors` (e.g. `["Unresolved Alerts"]`). Real examples seen: `IMPERIUM\adm.webb` (`privileged=true`, `adminCount=1`), `MOHIT\admin.one` (`riskFactors=["Unresolved Alerts"]`).

Build the factor table from AD with a `savelookup`:

```text
| datasource assets from 'surface/identity'
| filter resourceType='AD User' principalName=*
| let mult = privileged=true ? 2.0 : (number(adminCount) > 0 ? 1.5 : (serviceAccount=true ? 0.5 : 1.0))
| let reason = privileged=true ? 'Privileged (ISPM)' : (number(adminCount) > 0 ? 'adminCount>0 (ISPM)' : (serviceAccount=true ? 'Service account' : 'Standard AD user'))
| columns factor_key = principalName, factor_type = 'user', risk_multiplier = mult, reason
| limit 100000
| savelookup '{{PREFIX}}RiskFactors'
```

`principalName` (e.g. `IMPERIUM\adm.webb`) is the join key against the `risk_object` a user contributor emits. Layer extra weight from `riskFactors` (an account flagged `"Unresolved Alerts"`), Tier-0 OU membership (`distinguishedName` contains the privileged OU), or `memberOf` (Domain Admins) as the environment warrants. Refresh nightly (the collector or a refresh flow) so multipliers track AD changes. `privileged`/`serviceAccount` are booleans, compare with `=true` (not `'true'`). For hosts, the same pattern on `'surface/endpoint'` gives criticality/tags.

**No ISPM?** Fall back to the endpoint surface (`'surface/endpoint'`) for host context plus a hand-maintained static CSV (`assets/rba_risk_factors.csv.template`) for the rest.

## Step 3: contributors

Render the contributor PowerQueries from `rba_contributors.json`. Each ends in:

```text
| columns risk_object, risk_object_type, risk_score, base_score, mitre_tactic, mitre_technique, contributor, threat_object, threat_object_type, endpoint, risk_message | limit 1000
```

The collector unions/sequences these per run. Use `contains:anycase ('-enc', ...)` style predicates in collector queries rather than regex with `\s` escapes, to avoid multi-level escaping inside the workflow JSON.

## Step 4: collector (deploy as Shared Draft, then prompt, then activate)

> Import is not complete until published: treat `ha_import_workflow` and publish as ONE atomic step (publish in the SAME step as the import, never a follow-up). The collector must be a Shared Draft before you prompt the user to bind and activate.

Render `assets/rba_collector.workflow.template.json` (scheduled trigger, sync PowerQuery, MAP_TABLE, JQ-to-NDJSON, publish). Deploy in this order, this is mandatory because the SDL connection cannot be bound via API:

1. **Import** via `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/public/workflow-import-export/import?accountIds={{ACCOUNT_ID}}` with body `{"data": <workflow>}`. New workflows land as a Private Draft.
2. **Publish to Shared Draft** so the requester can see it: `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}/publish?accountIds={{ACCOUNT_ID}}` (bodyless, 204).
3. **Prompt the user** to open the flow and bind a connection on each of the two HTTP actions. This is a console step; the API cannot create or bind connections. **The two actions need different credentials, do not bind the same connection to both:**
   - **Run Contributors** (`POST {{S1_CONSOLE_URL}}/sdl/api/powerQuery`) takes the console JWT. The standard **"SentinelOne SDL" (Bearer)** connection is correct here. Keep it on this action and on any Management Console API action you add to the flow; only the collector action changes.
   - **Publish Risk Events** (`POST {{HEC_INGEST_URL}}/services/collector/event`) takes an **SDL Log Write Key**. A Hyperautomation connection sends its stored credential as a literal `Authorization: Bearer <value>` header, so the binding is a Bearer connection whose key value is the Log Write Key minted for the target account or site. Create that as a **second, separate connection**; do not reuse the console-token "SentinelOne SDL" connection, which the collector refuses with `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}`. Send **no** `S1-Scope` header on this action: the collector does not honour it, and the write key's scope is fixed at mint time, so the header cannot redirect the write.

4. **Activate** after the user confirms both connections are bound: `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}/{version_id}/activation?accountIds={{ACCOUNT_ID}}` (204). Auto-resolution by the platform is not something to rely on, always publish + prompt first, and never assume the ingest action inherited a usable credential: confirm with a run-now (step 5) that Publish Risk Events returned 200 and that fresh events actually query back out of `dataSource.name='risk'`.
5. **Run-now to test** (works on a scheduled-trigger workflow): `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/public/workflow-execution/manual/{id}/{version_id}?accountIds={{ACCOUNT_ID}}`, then poll `GET /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1/workflow-execution/{execution_id}?accountIds={{ACCOUNT_ID}}` until `state=Completed`; confirm `executed_actions` equals the action count and there are no `error_actions`. Validated: a 6-action collector ran in ~2.9s, 6/6 actions, clean.

Collector workflow shape (6 actions): scheduled_trigger to Run Contributors (`POST {{S1_CONSOLE_URL}}/sdl/api/powerQuery`, sync, returns `body.columns` + `body.values`) to Prep (variable: `cols` = `JQ(.columns, ".[].name")`, `jqFilter`) to Map Rows (variable: `MAP_TABLE(cols, values)`) to Build NDJSON (variable: `JQ(mapped, jqFilter, true)`) to Publish Risk Events (`POST {{HEC_INGEST_URL}}/services/collector/event?isParsed=true`, `use_authentication_data:true`, no `S1-Scope` header). The collector builds JSON server-side, so object names with backslashes (`DOMAIN\user`) are clean single-backslash values (no manual-escaping artifact).

`use_authentication_data:true` on Publish Risk Events means the action sends whatever credential its bound connection holds, as `Authorization: Bearer <value>`. That value must be an SDL Log Write Key; the console API token is refused. The action carries no `S1-Scope` header: the collector does not read it, and its presence previously masked the real requirement. Scope comes from the Log Write Key itself, so the key must be minted for the account or site the risk index belongs to.

## Step 5: incident rules

Deploy the four STAR scheduled rules (`assets/rba_incident_cumulative_score.template.json` and `assets/rba_incident_multitactic.template.json`, rendered per object type) via `POST /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules`, then enable with `PUT /web/api/v2.1/cloud-detection/rules/enable` body `{"filter": {"ids": [...]}}`. They report `Activating` and go Active within ~1 hour, then evaluate on cadence. All four: `queryType: scheduled`, `queryLang: 2.0`, `treatAsThreat: UNDEFINED`, `networkQuarantine: false`, `entityMappings: [{"columnName": "risk_object"}]`.

Cumulative-score body (per object type):

```text
dataSource.name='risk' risk_object_type='{{RISK_OBJECT_TYPE}}' risk_object=*
| group risk_score_total=sum(number(risk_score)), tactics=estimate_distinct(mitre_tactic), techniques=estimate_distinct(mitre_technique), contributors=estimate_distinct(contributor), events=count(), first_seen=oldest(timestamp), last_seen=newest(timestamp), top_message=max_by(risk_message, number(risk_score)) by risk_object
| filter risk_score_total >= {{THRESHOLD}}
| columns risk_object, risk_score_total, tactics, techniques, contributors, events, first_seen, last_seen, top_message
| sort -risk_score_total | limit 100
```

Multi-tactic body swaps the filter to `| filter tactics >= {{TACTIC_THRESHOLD}}` and sorts `-tactics`, with `runIntervalMinutes:1440`, `lookbackWindowMinutes:10080` (7d). Use `max_by`/`oldest`/`newest` (not `first`/`last`), and `number()` on `risk_score`.

## Step 6: dashboard

Render `assets/rba_dashboard.template.json` and `sdl_put_file` to `/dashboards/{{PREFIX}}-RBA`. Panels: risk-events / risk-objects / contributors number tiles, risk leaderboard (cumulative score per object, `showBarsColumn`), risk by MITRE tactic (donut), risk by contributor (donut), risk score over time by object type (stacked_bar, `transpose risk_object_type on timestamp`, safe single-token values), top threat objects (table), and the contributing-events timeline (table). Format timestamps with `simpledateformat(timestamp,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','UTC')` and put `sort` before `columns`.

## Optional: local demo console (UI)

`assets/rba_console/` is a self-contained, browser-based RBA console, optional, and great for demoing the model live. It runs on the presenter's laptop, not in the tenant. `server.py` is a zero-dependency Python proxy (macOS stdlib) that reads the SDL creds from the Claude Desktop config at runtime and proxies `/api/powerQuery`, `/api/getFile`, `/api/putFile` to the SDL xdr host, with the Bearer injected server-side so the browser holds no token and CORS is a non-issue. `index.html` is a 4-tab UI: Talk track, Deployed artefacts, Live risk (24h leaderboard from `dataSource.name='risk'`), and a Risk factor editor that reads / edits / saves `{{PREFIX}}RiskFactors.csv` with a live "projected impact" panel (Sigma base_score x current multiplier vs the fire threshold). Run: `cd rba_console && python3 server.py`, then open `http://localhost:8787` (the localhost URL, not `file://`, which has no proxy). Render `{{ACCOUNT_NAME}}`, `{{ACCOUNT_ID}}`, `{{PREFIX}}`, and the four `{{RULE_*_ID}}` tokens before a customer demo. See `assets/rba_console/README.md`.

## Optional: persisted decayed risk register

Dynamic windowed scoring (the incident rules over 24h / 7d) is the recommended default: self-cleaning, drift-free, and time-decayed for free. Add a persisted register ONLY when you need memory beyond the window or long-horizon entity trending (an object quietly accumulating over weeks, or a risk curve over months). `assets/rba_risk_register.savelookup.pq` maintains a running per-object score with time decay (`new = old * {{DECAY}} + today`, `{{DECAY}}` ~= 0.9 for a one-week half-life), deployed as a DAILY scheduled flow (reuse the collector shape). It complements, it does not replace, the dynamic incident rules: keep alerting on the windowed score and use the register for trend / executive views. The decay term is what keeps a persisted score from growing unbounded.

## Scoring example (worked)

A privileged AD user, `IMPERIUM\adm.webb` (ISPM: `privileged=true`, `adminCount=1`), so the factor table gives a x2.0 multiplier. Over a 24h window the collector publishes these risk events:

| Time (UTC) | Contributor | MITRE tactic / technique | base_score | x factor | risk_score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 09:02 | suspicious_powershell_flags | Execution / T1059.001 | 15 | 2.0 | 30 |
| 09:14 | ad_recon_burst | Discovery / T1087 | 15 | 2.0 | 30 |
| 09:31 | lolbin_download | Command and Control / T1105 | 20 | 2.0 | 40 |
| 10:05 | eventlog_clear | Defense Evasion / T1070.001 | 25 | 2.0 | 50 |

Cumulative 24h `risk_score_total` = **150** across **4 distinct MITRE tactics**.

- The **user 24h cumulative-score** rule (threshold >= 50) fires: 150 >= 50. One HIGH alert, entity-bound to `IMPERIUM\adm.webb`, carrying the four contributing events as its timeline.
- The **user 7d multi-tactic** rule (threshold >= 4 tactics) also fires if the same four spread over days rather than one burst.

The amplification is the point. The same four observations on a standard, non-privileged user (`IMPERIUM\adm.kowalski`, x1.0) total **75**, over threshold but ranked far below the privileged user. On a service account factored down to x0.5 they total **37.5**, *below* the 50 threshold, so it stays quiet, which is the intended noise suppression. Identical behaviour, different outcome, driven entirely by the AD-derived risk factor.

## Validation

1. ingest sample risk events; confirm they query back and aggregate per object.
2. Run one contributor over live EDR; confirm it emits well-formed risk-event rows.
3. Join the factor table; confirm `risk_score = base_score * multiplier` amplifies.
4. Run-now the collector; confirm `Completed`, all actions, clean, and fresh risk events appear in the index.
5. Confirm an incident rule produces one row per over-threshold object (run the body via LRQ); enable and confirm a UAM alert fires.
6. Open the dashboard; confirm panels render (send screenshots, render is a separate path from query validation).

## Gotchas

- **Collector connection is a console step.** Deploy as Shared Draft and prompt the user to bind the connections before activating. The API cannot bind connections; do not auto-activate.
- **Two credentials, one flow, two connections.** Run Contributors (`/sdl/api/powerQuery`) uses the console JWT via the "SentinelOne SDL" connection; Publish Risk Events (`/services/collector/event`) uses a separate Bearer connection holding an SDL Log Write Key, and sends no `S1-Scope` header. A Hyperautomation connection passes its credential through verbatim as `Authorization: Bearer <value>`, so one connection per credential is the whole mechanism. Binding the console connection to the ingest action fails with `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}`, which reads like a missing header but is really the wrong credential: adding the header does not help. Log Write Key scope is fixed at mint time and cannot be overridden per request.
- **Do not conflate the collector with UAM alert ingest.** `POST /v1/alerts` on the same ingest host is the opposite case: it takes the console API token AND requires the `S1-Scope` header. Only `/services/collector/*` is Log-Write-Key-and-no-scope-header.
- **Ingest manual-authoring backslash trap.** When hand-crafting ingest JSON, `DOMAIN\user` needs careful escaping and is easy to double. The collector's server-side JQ avoids this; prefer the collector over manual ingest for real data.
- **Numeric cast.** Always `number(risk_score)` before `sum`/arithmetic; SDL columns can be string-typed.
- **Cadence vs lookback.** Match the collector `startTime` and the cumulative-rule `lookbackWindowMinutes` to avoid double-publishing / overlap. Hourly collector with a 1h contributor window; 24h cumulative rule run hourly with dedup on (`disableStreaksLogic:false`) + a cool-off.
- **SYSTEM and service accounts dominate volume.** `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` and update tooling generate the most observations. Factor them down (multiplier < 1) or exclude them from contributors, or they top the leaderboard with benign noise. This is the standard RBA tuning lesson ("cultivate the ecology"). Tenant-confirmed 2026-07-06: on live EDR, `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` topped the leaderboard purely on volume; add an `AND NOT src.process.user in:anycase ('NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM','NT AUTHORITY\\LOCAL SERVICE','NT AUTHORITY\\NETWORK SERVICE')` clause to the contributor filter, or a `risk_multiplier` < 1 row for these principals.
- **risk_object must match the factor-table key, normalise it.** Live EDR emits `src.process.user` as `DOMAIN\user`, but an ISPM factor table keyed on `samAccountName` (or `principalName`) will not join, so every live object defaults to multiplier 1 (no amplification). Normalise one side: strip the domain in the contributor (emit the bare `samAccountName`) to match a samAccountName-keyed table, or key the factor table on `principalName` (`DOMAIN\user` form) to match the raw EDR value. Confirm the join returns non-1 multipliers before demoing.
- **Activation lag.** Enabled incident rules become Active within ~1 hour, then evaluate on cadence; the first alert is not instant.
- **Rule type.** Incident rules are `scheduled` PowerQuery rules; no inline mitigation (drive response from an HA flow off the alert).
