# SentinelOne SDL Solutions

This skill packages repeatable SDL solutions and deploys them into a specific customer
environment from a short set of prompts. It is an orchestration layer: it does not reimplement
PowerQuery, parser, SDL API, or Hyperautomation mechanics. Instead it collects the customer
parameters, renders the solution's templates, previews the result, deploys through the
primitive skills, and validates.

Use this skill when the user wants to deploy or tailor a whole solution. For a single query,
parser, dashboard, or workflow, use the matching primitive skill directly.

## Solution catalog

| Solution | What it does | Playbook |
|---|---|---|
| Data source onboarding | Take a raw log stream already reaching the tenant and operationalise it end to end from one short prompt: locate the source, normalise it to OCSF, enrich it with device/user context, then build a dashboard, MITRE-mapped detections, and a Hyperautomation flow | `references/data-source-onboarding.md` |
| Asset enrichment | Enrich ingested raw logs with device and user context (OS, IP, agent UUID, AD groups, SID, criticality, risk factors) from the Asset Inventory, at ingest or at query time | `references/asset-enrichment.md` |
| UEBA behavioural anomaly detection | Baseline ANY security or non-security signal per (action, principal) over a chosen window and detect deviations. Ten behavioural detections: core SPIKE, DROP, SILENT, NEW-BEHAVIOR plus advanced OFF-HOURS, FAN-OUT, RATIO, VELOCITY, PEER-GROUP, DORMANT; plus two location detections GEO-NEW and IMPOSSIBLE-TRAVEL when a Location field is set; plus Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) that consolidates alerts into one cumulative per-entity risk score. The source is matched by `dataSource.name` or `serverHost`, and the action can be a composite of 2-3 fields. A Sensitivity knob switches volume scoring between Standard (z-score) and Robust (percentile p95/p05, default); a use-case selector (account takeover, account takeover geo, brute force, insider / data exfil, lateral movement, privilege abuse, service/feed health, all, custom) presets detections and method. One-click production deploy: baseline lookups + scheduled PowerQuery rules + Hyperautomation watchdogs + staggered per-baseline nightly refresh + a daily failure-notifier + a review dashboard. The s1-ueba-deployer is the source of truth | `references/ueba-anomaly-detection.md` |
| Ingest health monitoring (per device) | Per-device ingest health: anomaly detection on a 7-day hour-of-day seasonal baseline refreshed daily, detecting when a specific firewall, endpoint, or server spikes, drops, lags (p95), or goes silent, plus parser drift. Deploys per-device baseline lookups, scheduled PowerQuery detections, an ingest-loss watchdog flow, a 5-tab dashboard, an email-notification flow for every failure, and an editable source-exclusions lookup and a device-level config lookup (source level by default, per-device opt-in), with unified Spike/Drop/Lag rules that tag each alert source or device; Parser Drift is optional and tuned per environment | `references/ingest-health-monitoring.md` |
| Detection exclusions (single-event, correlation, or scheduled) | Suppress known-good noise in a STAR Custom Detection rule over a third-party or EDR SDL source. **Ask the user the rule type first** (Step 0): a single-event rule (`queryType: events`) or a correlation rule (`queryType: correlation`) hardcodes the exclusion as an inline `AND NOT (<field> in:anycase (...))` negative list in a boolean S1QL body (correlation appends it to each sub-query in `correlationParams`), fires per event / on multi-event thresholds, and supports mitigation; or a scheduled PowerQuery detection (`queryType: scheduled`) loads a CSV exclusion list as an SDL lookup table and omits matching rows via an anti-join (`\| lookup ... \| filter <col> = null`), aggregates, and ships an effectiveness dashboard. Single-event and correlation deploy just the rule; scheduled deploys the lookup table, the rule, an optional source-of-truth refresh flow, and the dashboard | `references/custom-detection-exclusions.md` |
| Risk-Based Alerting (RBA) | Noisy-but-interesting observations are published as low-noise risk events into a `risk` index instead of alerting individually; risk accumulates per object (user / host), amplified by asset-derived risk factors; one high-fidelity alert fires only when a 24h cumulative score or 7d distinct-MITRE-tactic threshold is crossed, giving a contextualised story instead of disconnected alerts. Deploys contributors, a risk-factor table, a scheduled collector flow (**publish as Shared Draft, then prompt the user to bind the "SentinelOne SDL" connection, then activate**, the connection cannot be bound via API), four incident rules (user/host x score/tactics), and a dashboard. This is the heavyweight risk-index model (a dedicated `risk` index + collector + contributors + risk factors). For a lightweight alternative that scores the existing SentinelOne alert stream in place against an editable RiskWeights + AssetWatchlist table and fires one watchdog per entity, use the RBA built into the UEBA solution (the s1-ueba-deployer), see `references/ueba-anomaly-detection.md` | `references/risk-based-alerting.md` |
| Detection as Code (DaC) | Stand up a Git + CI pipeline where detection engineers author rules as TOML files, a pull request triggers validation and four-eyes review, and a merge syncs the changed rules to the SentinelOne Custom Detection Rule API. Scaffolds a starter repo (per-target-system folders, CODEOWNERS, branch-protection guidance), seeds working examples of all three rule types (single-event `events`, `correlation`, scheduled PowerQuery), and ships a zero-dependency TOML-to-API sync engine with idempotent create-or-update plus lint-on-PR and sync-on-merge CI for GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Azure Pipelines. Unlike the other solutions, DaC sets up a workflow OUTSIDE the tenant that pushes rules in | `references/detection-as-code.md` |
| Alert noise reduction | Find the (source, signature) pairs flooding the alert queue, separate ingested and already-actioned noise (block/drop/sinkhole/reset) from real S1 detections, then recommend an ingestion-severity filter (a console setting on the connector), deploy an auto-resolve Hyperautomation flow that closes already-mitigated alerts with a note, optionally preserve signal-worthy categories (e.g. C2/DGA) as one correlation rule, and ship a noise-vs-signal dashboard. All product/source/signature/action values are discovered live; nothing is hardcoded | `references/alert-noise-reduction.md` |

More solutions are added under `references/<solution>.md` plus templates under `assets/`. See
"Adding a new solution" below.

## How a deployment runs (always follow this loop)

1. **Pick the solution.** If the user named it, use it. Otherwise show the catalog and ask which one.
2. **Collect parameters with simple prompts.** Ask only what the playbook needs, one compact question set, with sensible defaults pre-filled. Never start deploying before parameters are confirmed. Each playbook lists its parameters and defaults.
3. **Confirm the environment.** Resolve the target site name to a siteId (fuzzy match, console site names can contain spaces). Confirm the console/tenant. Read existing config versions before any overwrite.
4. **Render and preview.** Fill the templates in `assets/` with the parameters and show the user the final config (queries, parser, workflow) and the projected enriched record BEFORE deploying. This is a dry run.
5. **Deploy in dependency order** through the primitive skills (see each playbook for the exact order). Typical order: build lookup tables, then parser or lookup guidance, then refresh flow.
6. **Validate** with a real ingest and query, and report what populated. Use `metadata.version` as the propagation canary for parser changes.
7. **Test end to end with run-now, then prompt the user.** For any solution with HA flows, trigger each flow immediately with `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/public/workflow-execution/manual/{id}/{version}?accountIds=<acct>` (works on scheduled-trigger flows once active), poll `GET .../workflow-execution/{exec_id}` until `state` is `Completed` with `error_actions: []` and `executed_actions` == the action count, and confirm the downstream effect (tables written, dashboard renders, a detection alert present). An import is NOT complete until the flow is published to a Shared Draft: treat `ha_import_workflow` and publish as ONE atomic step, publish in the SAME step as the import, never as a follow-up. Imported flows land as PRIVATE DRAFTS owned by the API token's user (invisible in the console to the person who asked), so IMMEDIATELY after each `ha_import_workflow` publish it to a Shared Draft: `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}/publish?siteIds=<id>` (bodyless `{}`, returns 204; use `accountIds=<acct>` for account-scoped flows). A published flow stays inactive until its connection is bound and it is activated, so always end a deployment by prompting the user to bind/activate and run this E2E check (offer to run it for them once active).
8. **Summarize** the deployed artifacts (paths, IDs, site) and hand off the rendered config files.

Keep prompts simple and few. Prefer defaults the user can accept with one word over long forms.

## Dependencies (load as needed)

This skill orchestrates the SentinelOne primitive skills. Load the ones a playbook calls for:

- `powerquery` for `datasource` + `savelookup` queries and the LRQ runner. The `references/datasource-command.md` there is the source of truth for the assets datasource.
- `sdl-api` (or the `s1-secops-mcp` tools `sdl_put_file`, `sdl_get_file`, `hec_ingest`) to deploy config files and ingest test data. Config-file writes use the console API token; `hec_ingest` needs an SDL Log Write Key in `S1_HEC_TOKEN` instead, and because that key is minted for one account or site it also fixes where test data lands, which no scope argument overrides.
- `sdl-log-parser` for parser authoring and the computeFields lookup pattern.
- `hyperautomation` for the scheduled refresh workflow.
- `mgmt-console-api` (or `s1-secops-mcp` `s1_api_*`) for site lookup and scoped workflow import / activate / deactivate.

## Conventions

- **Naming prefix.** Every artifact a deployment creates is prefixed with a customer or solution code so multiple deployments coexist cleanly: tables `<prefix>IdentityLookup` / `<prefix>EndpointLookup`, parser `<prefix>_enrich`, workflow `<prefix> Asset Lookups`.
- **Scope by site.** Deploy to the customer's site. Resolve the name to a siteId and pass it on every scoped call. The HA import, activation, and deactivation all require the scope parameter.
- **Empty suppression.** Inventory empties (for example `riskFactors` as the string `"[]"`) are converted to null in the savelookup so enrichment never writes an empty field.
- **Preview before deploy.** Always show rendered config and an example enriched record first.
- **Idempotence.** Read the current version of any SDL config file before overwriting, and pass it as the expected version. Hyperautomation import always creates a new workflow, so to update one, replace it rather than re-import blindly.
- **Dashboards: create by name once, update by udoId.** Only `/dashboards/` files carry a `udoId`; everything else (`/lookups/`, `/datatables/`, `/logParsers/`, `/automaticLookups`) is name-addressed. A name-addressed write to an existing dashboard creates a duplicate instead of updating it, so record the `udoId` returned by the initial create and address the dashboard by `udoId` on every later write. Solutions are re-runnable, so a name-addressed re-deploy silently doubles the dashboard on each run.
- **Asset mapping is built in.** Any parser or detection a solution creates must carry the minimum attributes that let an alert bind its Target Asset, so alerts are not "Unknown Device". The endpoint lookup captures `device_agentid` (the numeric console agent id); the parser stamps `device.uid` = `device_agentid` plus an endpoint `class_uid`; and scheduled detections set `entityMappings` on the device identity columns (`device_host` / `device_agentid` / `device_agentuuid`). Binding reconciles `device.uid` against the live Asset Inventory, so a real enrolled agent id is required (a fabricated id stays Unknown Device). The tested binding matrix and the minimum set live in `powerquery/references/detection-rules.md`.

## Adding a new solution

1. Write `references/<solution>.md` as a self-contained playbook: parameters with defaults, render steps, deploy order through the primitives, validation, gotchas.
2. Add the rendered templates to `assets/`.
3. Add a row to the Solution catalog table above and name the new solution in this skill's frontmatter description so it triggers.
4. Keep each solution self-contained so the router can branch cleanly.
