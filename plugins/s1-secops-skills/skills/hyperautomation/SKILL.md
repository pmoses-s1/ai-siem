  Use this skill whenever a user wants to create, design, build, generate, write, or export
  a SentinelOne Hyperautomation workflow in JSON format. Triggers: any mention of
  "Hyperautomation", "workflow", "automation", "SOAR", "playbook", "alert response",
  "trigger", "scheduled workflow", "webhook workflow", or any request to automate a
  SentinelOne-related security task, even phrased casually ("build me a thing that disables
  a user when an alert fires"). Also triggers when the user asks to import, export, test,
  validate, or submit a workflow to a SentinelOne console via API, and for autonomous /
  auto-response SOC requests: "autonomous SOC", "SOC in a box", "auto-triage", "investigate
  and respond automatically", "auto-isolate on a critical alert", "auto-close false
  positives and escalate real threats", or letting an LLM decide isolate vs quarantine vs
  close per alert (the canonical investigate-decide-respond shape lives in
  references/autonomous-soc-template.md). When in doubt, use it.

# SentinelOne Hyperautomation Skill

This skill enables Claude to design and generate valid SentinelOne Hyperautomation workflow
JSON, explain the logic behind workflows, and optionally submit them to a live console via API.

> **Sandbox proxy blocked?** If import/export API calls to `*.sentinelone.net` fail with a connection or proxy error inside the Claude sandbox, use the `s1-secops-mcp` server instead. It runs locally via `node` and bypasses the sandbox proxy entirely. Setup: add it to `claude_desktop_config.json` (see `s1-secops-mcp/README.md`). The MCP server exposes `ha_list_workflows`, `ha_get_workflow`, `ha_import_workflow`, and `ha_export_workflow`, all running from your machine against the Hyperautomation API.

## Minimum viable workflow JSON (smoke test)

Before building production workflows, validate your token + scope using the
smallest payload the `/import` endpoint accepts: a manual trigger with no
inputs. Use this to confirm the API path works end-to-end (import → activate)
before iterating on real action graphs.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "minimal-smoke-test",
    "description": "validates the import path",
    "actions": [
      {
        "action": {
          "client_data": {
            "collapsed": false,
            "dimensions": { "height": 76.0, "width": 256.0 },
            "position": { "x": 286.0, "y": -29.0 }
          },
          "connection_id": null,
          "connection_name": null,
          "data": {
            "action_type": "manual_trigger",
            "dynamic_properties": {},
            "name": "Manual Trigger",
            "static_payload": "{}",
            "trigger_type": "dynamic"
          },
          "description": null,
          "integration_id": null,
          "tag": "core_action",
          "type": "manual_trigger",
          "use_connection_name": false
        },
        "connected_to": [],
        "export_id": 0,
        "parent_action": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `dynamic_properties: {}` is valid: the manual-trigger node renders with no input fields.
- **Import is not complete until published: treat create/import and publish as ONE atomic step, publish in the SAME step, never as a follow-up. ALWAYS publish a newly created or imported workflow to a Shared Draft.** A workflow created or imported via the API lands as a **Private Draft owned by the API token's user** (for example, the service user), so it is invisible in the console to the human who requested it. Immediately after a successful import, publish it: `POST /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/publish?accountIds=<acct>` (bodyless `{}`, returns 204; state stays `inactive`, meaning shared but not running). Use `siteIds=<id>` for a site-scoped workflow. See `references/api-integration.md` section 8a. Skip this only when you are activating the workflow, since activation auto-publishes. You can only publish a draft owned by the token's user; publishing another user's private draft returns 403 "Workflow can't be published".
- Activate the imported workflow with
  `POST /workflows/{workflow_id}/{version_id}/activation?siteIds=<id>` (returns 204).
- Don't forget the scope param: see `references/api-integration.md` for the
  `siteIds=` pitfall (the wrong shape returns 403 "Insufficient permissions"
  that looks like a missing role).

## How to use this skill

When a user asks to build a workflow, follow this process:

### Step 1: Understand the intent

Ask (or infer from context):

- What should trigger the workflow? (alert, schedule, webhook, manual, email)
- What integrations are needed? (SentinelOne, M365, Slack, VirusTotal, etc.)
- What is the desired outcome? (enrich alert, disable user, send notification, etc.)
- Should the workflow run automatically or on-demand?

### Step 2: Warn about integrations

**CRITICAL**: Before generating JSON, identify any integration-backed actions (tag = "integration").
These require pre-configured connections in the console that CANNOT be *created* via API. (An EXISTING connection CAN be pre-bound programmatically: set `integration_id` = the connection's id on each `http_request` action in the import JSON with `use_authentication_data: true`, then activate via `POST .../workflows/{id}/{version_id}/activation`; no manual UI binding needed. One connection also serves actions that hit different hosts, e.g. the LRQ console host and the `/v1/alerts` ingest host, since auth is header-injected regardless of the URL, PROVIDED both endpoints take the same credential. HEC event-collector actions (`/services/collector/*`) do not: they need their own connection holding an SDL Log Write Key, see "Connection requirement" below.)
Always tell the user: *"This workflow uses the [X, Y, Z] integrations. Before importing, you must
configure connections for these in your Hyperautomation → Integrations section."*

Integration-backed actions have `"tag": "integration"` and a non-null `integration_id`.
Core actions (Variable, Loop, Condition, Delay, Send Email, HTTP Request without integration,
Break Loop, Snippet, Wait for Slack, Create Interaction, LLM) have `"tag": "core_action"`.

**Packaged vs ad-hoc integration actions.** Every built-in integration ships an action pack. A
packaged action carries `data.public_action_id` (a pack UUID) and a pre-filled `data.url_path`;
an ad-hoc action has `public_action_id: null` and a URL you write yourself. In production, 71%
of `http_request` steps (3,822 of 5,418) use a packaged action. **Prefer a packaged action when
one exists** and keep `url`, `url_path` and `public_action_id` consistent.

The action packs are not queryable: `GET /integrations/{id}` returns connection and auth metadata
only, `/integrations/{id}/actions` is 404, and there is no `GET /integrations` list endpoint (405).
So use `references/integration-catalog.md`, which records all 266 packaged actions across 45
integrations plus the ad-hoc calls, mined from a live tenant. To see what a specific console has,
enumerate with `GET /hyper-automate/api/v1/connections/scope` and resolve each distinct
`integration_id` via `GET /hyper-automate/api/v1/integrations/{id}`.

### Step 3: Generate the JSON

Read `references/workflow-schema.md` to produce a valid workflow JSON.
Read `references/building-blocks.md` for the correct action type structures.
Read `references/functions-reference.md` for available functions and their syntax.

### Step 4: Validate before outputting

Self-check against `references/validation-rules.md` before presenting the workflow.

If the workflow chains `Function.JQ` steps, builds a time window, or fails a run deliberately, also read `references/expressions-gotchas.md`. It covers the failures that only appear at runtime or activation: `Function.JQ(...,true)` returns a STRING so the next JQ cannot index it; `PARSE_JSON` rejects an already-materialised object; a `local_var` is invisible to the action that defines it; quote-bearing expressions inlined in an http_request payload fail at ACTIVATION with `invalid_references`; absolute calendar-day windows via `FORMATTED_DATE`; using `evaluate-expression` as a pre-deploy test loop; the fake-attribute throw idiom; and why retrying a poll cannot revive a dead LRQ.

### Step 5: API submission (optional)

If the user wants to submit to a live console, read `references/api-integration.md`.

**Credentials**: The plugin's SessionStart hook auto-discovers a `credentials.json`
dropped directly into the user's Cowork project folder at the start of every session.
If the file is missing, ask the user to drop a `credentials.json` into their project folder.

Resolution priority (highest wins):

1. Environment variables `S1_CONSOLE_URL` / `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`
2. `<project folder>/credentials.json` (auto-discovered)
3. Ask the user to provide their console URL and personal Console User API token

To read credentials in Python:

```python
import json, os
from pathlib import Path
_creds = {}
for candidate in (
    Path.home() / ".claude" / "sentinelone" / "credentials.json",
    Path(os.environ.get("COWORK_WORKSPACE", "")) / ".sentinelone" / "credentials.json"
        if os.environ.get("COWORK_WORKSPACE") else None,
    Path(os.environ.get("CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR", "")) / "sentinelone" / "credentials.json"
        if os.environ.get("CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR") else None,
    Path.home() / ".config" / "sentinelone" / "credentials.json",
):
    if candidate and candidate.is_file():
        _creds = json.loads(candidate.read_text())
        break
S1_CONSOLE_URL  = os.environ.get("S1_CONSOLE_URL")  or _creds.get("S1_CONSOLE_URL")  or None
S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN = os.environ.get("S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN") or _creds.get("S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN") or None
```

Once resolved, validate them using the two-step test in `references/api-integration.md`
(system health check + token permission check). Only proceed with import/trigger/activate
after both checks pass. Always use a personal Console User API token, not a Service User
token; see `references/api-integration.md` for the reason.

### Step 6: Publish so the requester can see it (REQUIRED after any API import)

A workflow imported or created via the API is a **Private Draft owned by the token's user** and is not visible to anyone else in the console, including the person who asked for it. Treat import and publish as ONE atomic step (an import is not complete until it is a Shared Draft; publish in the same step, never a follow-up). After a successful import, ALWAYS publish it to a **Shared Draft**:
`POST /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/publish?accountIds=<acct>` (bodyless `{}`, returns 204). The workflow stays `inactive` (shared but not running). Use `siteIds=<id>` for a site-scoped workflow. Skip this step only when you are activating the workflow, since activation publishes automatically. See `references/api-integration.md` section 8a.

- **Deactivate + delete (removal lifecycle).** To remove a workflow: if it is active, deactivate it first with `POST /hyper-automate/api/public/workflows/{workflow_id}/deactivate?siteIds=<id>` (bodyless, returns 204; no `version_id` needed), then `DELETE /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}?siteIds=<id>` (returns 204, soft/recoverable). Deleting a still-active workflow returns `400 "Active workflows cannot be archived"`, so deactivate-then-delete is the required order. See `references/api-integration.md` sections 8 and 8b.

## Decision guide: pick the right pattern by use case

The catalog (`references/building-blocks-catalog.md`) names every reusable block. Use this
table to jump straight to the right starting point:

| User says... | Start with | Composite patterns to layer on |
|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| "When an alert fires, do X" | A1 (Singularity Response Trigger) + recipe C1 | B1 safe-field DEFAULT chain, B2 success/fail branch, B6 add-note |
| "Every day / every N hours, do X" | A3 (Scheduled Trigger) + recipe C2 | B7 SDL ingest, B9 IOC create, B5 JQ shaping |
| "When a webhook hits, do X" | A4 (HTTP Trigger) + recipe C3 | B2 status-code branch, B11 Slack ack |
| "Let an analyst kick this off with parameters" | A2 dynamic Manual Trigger + recipe C4 | B5 JQ shaping, B4 APPEND accumulator |
| "Wait for analyst approval before remediating" | recipe C5 (Slack approval), or `references/interaction-forms.md` for an in-console form | B11 Slack interactive, B6 add-note |
| "Ask a person for structured input mid-run" / "richer approval than yes or no" | `references/interaction-forms.md` (Create Interaction type `form` + Wait for Interaction) | guard EVERY optional field with `Function.DEFAULT`, fail-closed condition |
| "AI investigates, human approves the action" | `references/autonomous-soc-template.md` → analyst-approved remediation variant | agentic investigation, poll snippet, `llm` brief, approval form |
| "Periodic posture / UEBA report" | A3 + recipe C6 | B8 PowerQuery, B7 SDL ingest |
| "Page through a paginated API" | B3 (cursor + break_loop) | B4 APPEND accumulator |
| "Summarize this evidence with an LLM" | B12 (OpenAI) | B6 add-note |
| "Create a Threat Intelligence indicator" | B9 (TI IOC create) | B4 accumulator inside loop |
| "Add a note on the alert" | B6 (UAM GraphQL addAlertNote) | always wrap text in `Function.HTML_ENCODE` |
| "Auto-investigate and respond to alerts end to end" | `references/autonomous-soc-template.md` | reusable response snippets + dynamic `snippet_20` dispatch, poll-until-complete loop |
| "Reuse this step across several flows" / "stop copy-pasting this logic" | `references/snippets.md` (author a snippet, call it with `snippet_20`) | `use_latest_snippet_version` to auto-track edits |

**Reuse via snippets is the default for shared logic.** Whenever the same action graph would appear in more than one workflow (a response action, a notification, a poll loop), build it once as a snippet and call it with a `snippet_20` node instead of duplicating it. See `references/snippets.md`.

The 19 action types **observed in production** (1,244 workflows across 7 tenants) are:
`http_request`, `variable`, `condition`, `loop`, `singularity_response_trigger`,
`send_email`, `break_loop`, `data_formation`, `manual_trigger`, `snippet`, `delay`,
`wait_for_slack`, `http_trigger`, `scheduled_trigger`, `create_interaction`,
`wait_for_interaction`, `llm`, `email_trigger`, `snippet_20`.

This is an **observed** list, not the product's declared list, and there is no API that returns
the declared one. One known gap: the S-26.2 docs describe a **SQL action** (PostgreSQL, MySQL,
MSSQL) that appears in zero workflows in the corpus, so its JSON `type` string is unverified.
Before emitting an action type outside the 19, confirm it by building one in the console UI and
exporting the workflow to read its `type`. Do not guess the string.

> **Snippet node types.** *Calling* a snippet from a workflow uses a `snippet_20` node (not `snippet`). *Authoring* a snippet uses a `snippet_trigger` (inputs) + `snippet_output` (returns) in place of a normal trigger. See `references/snippets.md`.

## Example patterns (in references/)

Annotated real examples to use as structural references:

- `references/building-blocks-catalog.md`: patterns mined from 1,205 production workflows. Atomic node shapes (Section A), composite idioms such as condition branches with success/fail notes, loops with APPEND and BREAK logic, and integration-backed HTTP requests with connection placeholders (Section B), plus full use-case recipes (Section C) and anti-patterns (Section E).
- `references/snippets.md`: authoring and calling reusable snippets, with worked `snippet_trigger`, `snippet_output`, and `snippet_20` node shapes.
- `references/autonomous-soc-template.md`: the canonical end-to-end investigate-decide-respond workflow template, plus the analyst-approved-remediation variant and the Purple AI agentic investigation call shapes.
- `references/interaction-forms.md`: form-based interactions end to end, product behaviour plus the tenant-validated JSON layer.

---

## Quick reference: action name → slugified reference

When referencing a previous action in `{{...}}` syntax, use the kebab-case version of the
action's `name` field. Examples:

- Action named "Get Agents with Active Threat" → `{{get-agents-with-active-threat.body.data}}`
- Action named "SDL Query" → `{{sdl-query.body.matches[0].attributes.actor_user_email_addr}}`
- Action named "Singularity Response Trigger" → `{{singularity-response-trigger.data.id}}`
- Action named "Loop the list of IPv4" → `{{loop-the-list-of-ipv4.item}}`

The rule: lowercase, spaces become hyphens, special characters dropped.

> ⚠️ **Hyphens and other punctuation in a name are DROPPED, not converted to hyphens.** Only spaces
> become hyphens. So an action named "Launch CIDR-Excluded Detection" slugifies to
> `launch-cidrexcluded-detection` (the `CIDR-Excluded` hyphen is removed, merging the words), NOT
> `launch-cidr-excluded-detection`. Referencing the wrong slug fails with "Action contains invalid
> references". **Avoid hyphens/punctuation in the name of any action you reference**, use plain
> space-separated words (e.g. "Launch Detection" → `launch-detection`), or copy the exact slug the
> UI shows.

---

## Integration warning template

Use this when the workflow contains integration-backed actions:

> ⚠️ **Pre-requisite integrations to configure before importing:**
>
> - **[Integration Name]**: used for [action name(s)]. Configure at Hyperautomation → Integrations → [Integration Name] → Add Connection.
> - *(repeat for each)*
>
> Once configured, note the connection name; you may need to update the `connection_name` field in the JSON before importing.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- ❌ Referencing an OPTIONAL interaction-form field directly. A field the respondent left blank is
  ABSENT from `response.result`, and a bare reference to an absent attribute ERRORS the whole run.
  The flow passes testing (every field filled) then dies in production on the first skipped field.
  ✅ Wrap every optional field: `{{Function.DEFAULT(wait-slug.response.result.field, "not provided")}}`.
  See `references/interaction-forms.md`.
- ❌ Rendering a markdown-bearing field (notably Purple AI's `aiInvestigations[].result`) straight
  into an HTML email or Slack message. Email clients do not render markdown, so it arrives as one
  unbroken wall of `##`, `**` and `-`.
  ✅ Convert with an `llm` action that emits the target format, keep the raw field for the audit
  trail only. See `references/autonomous-soc-template.md`.
- ❌ Putting the human-approval form BEFORE the AI investigation (asking a person which alert to
  investigate). That inverts the value of both features.
  ✅ AI investigates first, the analyst reviews the findings and approves the remediation.
- ❌ Defining multiple variables in a single Variable action when one references another; they evaluate simultaneously and will fail with "variable not found"
  ✅ Always use one Variable action per variable when chaining references. One var → one action, always.
- ❌ Forgetting `Function.HTML_ENCODE` on note text passed to UAM GraphQL. Any quote, ampersand, or angle bracket breaks the mutation string.
  ✅ Always wrap: `\\\"{{Function.HTML_ENCODE(local_var.note)}}\\\"`.
- ❌ Encoding `compared_value` for `comparison_operator: "in"` as a raw JSON array.
  ✅ JSON-string-encode it: `"[\"HIGH\",\"CRITICAL\"]"`.
- ❌ `condition_type: "simple"`: never used in active corpus. Always emit `"multi"`.
- ❌ `wait_for_interaction` using `interaction_id` / `value` field names (older docs).
  ✅ Real fields are `identifier` / `time_value`.
- ❌ Hard-coding site IDs in TI IOC creates: breaks on tenant transfer.
  ✅ Pull from a Variable, Manual Trigger param, or `singularity-response-trigger.data.scopeId`.
- ❌ Importing with a Service User token: workflows become invisible to humans in the UI.
  ✅ Always use a personal Console User API token for `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`.
- ❌ Running an SDL PowerQuery (LRQ / `datasource` / `savelookup`) from an HTTP action bound to the **"SentinelOne"** mgmt connection. That connection signs as `Authorization: ApiToken`, but the SDL query endpoints (`POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` and `POST {sdl-host}/api/powerQuery`) require `Bearer`, so the action returns `HTTP 500 "Header must start with Bearer"`.
  ✅ Bind the **"SentinelOne SDL"** connection (Bearer by default) on the HTTP action. Notes: the ApiToken-only `/web/api/v2.1/dv/events/pq` cannot run the `datasource` command (returns 400) and is just an async wrapper over LRQ, so it is not usable for asset/inventory refresh; `/api/powerQuery` on the SDL host is synchronous (one call completes a `savelookup`) while `/sdl/v2/api/queries` is async. Tenant-validated 2026-06-13.
- ❌ Ingesting OCSF / structured events into AI SIEM via HEC (`/services/collector/event?isParsed=true`) without SentinelOne source-attribution fields. OCSF omits them, so events land with a null source (no attribution, degraded console rendering, and `dataSource.name`-based filters/detections miss).
  ✅ Include `dataSource.name`, `dataSource.vendor`, `dataSource.category` (set to `security`, required for AI SIEM to process custom OCSF sources), `event.type`, and `site_id`. Emit `event.type` as a FLAT dotted key (`"event.type": "..."`); a nested `event:{...}` object is dropped on ingest because `event` is a HEC-reserved key.
- ❌ **Leaving every action's `client_data.position` at `{x:0,y:0}`.** The flow runs fine but the console renders every node stacked on top of itself, unreadable. ALWAYS lay out the graph (tenant-validated 2026-07-18).
  ✅ Assign real coordinates: top-level nodes (`parent_action: null`) step DOWN the y-axis (~180px apart, x=0); a loop's child nodes (`parent_action` = the loop's `export_id`) sit INSIDE the loop container at an x offset (~210) stepping down (~180px). Give the `loop` a large `client_data.dimensions` (e.g. `{width:620,height:720}`) so it encloses its children. A one-pass layout after you build the action list is enough; see the reference `_layout(actions)` pattern:

  ```python
  def _layout(actions):
      top_y, child_y = 0, {}
      for a in actions:
          cd = a["action"].setdefault("client_data", {})
          if a.get("parent_action") is None:
              cd["position"] = {"x": 0, "y": top_y}
              if a["action"]["type"] == "loop":
                  cd["dimensions"] = {"width": 620, "height": 720}; top_y += 190 + 720
              else: top_y += 190
          else:
              y = child_y.get(a["parent_action"], 60)
              cd["position"] = {"x": 210, "y": y}; child_y[a["parent_action"]] = y + 180
  ```

- ❌ **Binding an http_request action to a CONNECTION id.** Setting `action.integration_id` to a specific connection instance's id imports + activates fine (204) but FAILS AT RUNTIME with `"Must provide connection in order..."` (activation does not validate the binding; see below). Tenant-validated 2026-07-18.
  ✅ Bind the built-in **integration (action-pack) id**, the value `discover`/list returns as the workflow action's `integration_id` (e.g. the SentinelOne SDL action-pack id). A connection created via `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/v1/connections` returns a *connection* id; do NOT bind that, bind the integration id it was created under, and rely on a connection existing under that integration.
- ❌ **Trusting activation (204) as proof a flow works.** Activation validates neither connection binding nor `{{Function.JQ}}` references.
  ✅ Always run-now (or the per-action **Test Action**) after activating and confirm state `Completed` with empty `error_actions`.
- ❌ **Reading an http_request's `status` field to decide whether the call worked.** `status` is `"success"` whenever ANY response arrives, including `404`/`4xx`. A flow that branches on it treats an error body as data. Tenant-validated 2026-08-09.
  ✅ Branch on `{{action-slug.status_code}}` (top level of the action output, NOT under `.body`). `continue_on_fail` governs transport failures, not HTTP status; only `retry_on_status_codes` reacts to codes, and it cannot help with a terminal 4xx.
- ❌ **Triggering run-now on several flows concurrently.** Executions park in `Running` with `executed_actions: 0` indefinitely, and abandoned parked executions accumulate and hold scheduler slots (10 observed on one tenant after a day of killed harnesses, blocking new runs). Tenant-validated 2026-08-09.
  ✅ Serialise run-now. To clear a parked execution: `deactivate` → `activate` → run again (a full delete of the workflow also releases it). Before blaming a flow that will not start, check `workflow-execution` for `state: Running` + `executed_actions: 0`. Calibrate any "is it stuck?" timeout against measured healthy start latency: a heavy flow legitimately sat at 0 actions for ~82s before completing with 40.
- ❌ **`select((ARR | index(.field)) != null)` in `Function.JQ`.** The `| index(...)` pipe rebinds `.` to `ARR`, so `.field` then indexes the array → `Cannot index array with string "field"`.
  ✅ Bind first: `select(.field as $n | (ARR | index($n)) != null)`. And when building HTML inside a `Function.JQ` string, use SINGLE-quoted HTML attributes so the only double quotes are jq string delimiters (pre-escaping `\"` inside collides with the wrapper's single quote-escape and the platform reports "Invalid References").
- ❌ Guarding a destructive action (block, isolate, disable) with a fail-OPEN approval gate (`... not_equals "dismissed"`). A `wait_for_slack` / `wait_for_interaction` timeout yields an empty value that passes `not_equals`, so the action auto-runs with **no** approval.
  ✅ Fail CLOSED: test `... equals "approved"` and route the destructive action off the `"true"` branch only (see `references/validation-rules.md` → Condition rules).
- ❌ Setting `parent_action` to a previous (non-loop) node's `export_id` to express flow order: this returns import `422 "Invalid workflow data"` even when everything else looks correct. `parent_action` is loop-membership ONLY.
  ✅ `parent_action: null` on every node that is not inside a loop; wire flow order strictly via `connected_to.target` (see `references/validation-rules.md` → Import / `parent_action` rules).
- ❌ Writing back to an alert (note / analyst verdict / status) via the old `/web/api/v2.0/threats` REST endpoints: they are decommissioned and return HTTP 405.
  ✅ Use the Unified Alerts GraphQL API (`POST /web/api/v2.1/unifiedalerts/graphql`) for every write-back, not just notes (see `references/api-integration.md` → SentinelOne alert write-backs).

## Running an SDL LRQ from an HA flow (async launch + poll): tenant-validated 2026-06-22

**Rule: always read SDL data from an HA flow via LRQ, never the synchronous `/api/powerQuery`.** The sync endpoint returns truncated / incomplete responses for large result sets (measured ~1/5 success on a ~1 MB `dataset` read; LRQ was 5/5) and is deprecated. Use LRQ for every SDL read from a workflow, including `dataset` / lookup-table reads, regardless of size. Reference `{{Connection.protocol}}{{Connection.url}}/sdl/v2/api/queries` so the host comes from the bound "SentinelOne SDL" connection, not a hardcoded tenant.

**Datatables are scope-specific.** A table saved with `savelookup` at site scope is not visible to a read at account scope (or an LRQ scoped by `accountIds`), and vice versa. Create the lookup in the same scope the flow reads.

`POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` is ASYNC. The launch response is NOT the results: it returns `body.id`
plus `body.stepsCompleted` / `body.stepsTotal`, and `body.data` is `null` while the query is still
running. The query id is also EPHEMERAL; it expires shortly after the query finishes. So a fixed
wait fails BOTH ways: too short returns `data: null` (still running); too long returns HTTP 404
"query id not found" (the id expired, and the downstream reference then resolves to
`UnresolvedLanguageReference`). Do NOT use one long delay. Use a tight POLL LOOP that reads the moment
the query is done. Required pattern (tenant-validated 2026-06-25):

1. **Launch**: `POST {{Connection.protocol}}{{Connection.url}}/sdl/v2/api/queries` with body
   `{"queryType":"PQ","tenant":true,"startTime":...,"endTime":...,"queryPriority":"HIGH","pq":{"query":...,"resultType":"TABLE"}}`.
   Capture `body.id` AND the `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag` response header (mandatory, session-scoped,
   echoed on every GET/DELETE) into local vars. Extract the header case-insensitively with JQ:
   `{{Function.JQ(launch-slug.headers, "to_entries | map(select(.key|ascii_downcase==\"x-dataset-query-forward-tag\")) | .[0].value", true)}}`.
2. **Poll loop**: a `loop` (while, capped, e.g. 60 iterations) whose FIRST inner action is the GET
   `GET {{Connection.protocol}}{{Connection.url}}/sdl/v2/api/queries/{{local_var.query_id}}?lastStepSeen=0`,
   echoing header `X-Dataset-Query-Forward-Tag: {{local_var.forward_tag}}`. Then a condition on the
   POLL body (NOT the launch body, the launch body is captured once and never updates inside the loop):
   done when `{{poll-slug.body.stepsCompleted}} = {{poll-slug.body.stepsTotal}}` (operator `equals`;
   the done-condition field is **`stepsTotal`**. Live-verified 2026-07-29 by dumping a raw LRQ poll
   body: it carries BOTH `stepsTotal` and `totalSteps` (both equal, e.g. 2), so either works and
   neither doc was wrong about the key existing; use `stepsTotal` for consistency with pq.py and the
   SDL docs). TRUE → consume results + `break_loop`. FALSE → a
   short `delay` (~5s) as the leaf of the false branch; the loop then re-iterates and re-polls.

   **Read both counters through JQ WITH DEFAULTS, and gate on `> 0`.** A bare
   `{{poll-slug.body.stepsTotal}}` ERRORS the whole run when a poll response omits the attribute
   ("Attribute totalSteps not found in Action poll-silent-pairs"), which kills a watchdog whose
   query was fine. Use `{{Function.JQ(poll-slug.body, "(.stepsCompleted // -1)", true)}}` against
   `{{Function.JQ(poll-slug.body, "(.stepsTotal // 0)", true)}}`, plus a second condition
   `stepsTotal greater_than 0`. Without the `> 0` gate a pre-assignment 0/0 first poll satisfies
   `equals` and the flow processes an EMPTY result set as complete, which for a baseline refresh
   silently writes a stub that then suppresses every detection reading it.

   **Gate the loop on a 4xx, or a killed query spins to the workflow timeout.** The backend can
   terminate a running LRQ; the poll then answers `404 {"code":"not_found"}` for the rest of the
   run. HA does NOT treat that as a failed action, its `status` is `"success"` whenever a response
   arrives whatever the code, so with the JQ defaults above the equality never matches and the loop
   iterates until the run times out (17+ iterations observed live). `continue_on_fail: false` does
   NOT help, verified live: status codes are actionable only via `retry_on_status_codes`, and
   retrying a dead token is pointless. Put a condition BETWEEN the poll and the done-check:

   ```jsonc
   {"input_value": "{{poll-slug.status_code}}", "compared_value": "400",
    "comparison_operator": "greater_than_or_equals"}
   //   true  -> an action that ENDS the run
   //   false -> the existing done-check
   ```

   `status_code` sits at the TOP level of the action output, not under `.body`. To end the run
   deliberately, reference an attribute that cannot exist (e.g.
   `{{poll-slug.body.LRQ_TERMINATED_BY_BACKEND}}`): a missing attribute is the one mechanism
   observed to fail an HA run outright, and the attribute name becomes the console error text, so
   name it descriptively. Ending in Error is also what a health-notifier flow keys on. Silent
   completion is strictly worse than a loud failure here. Verified live: the flow that had been
   spinning errored in 103s after 6 actions with the sentinel named in `error_actions`.
3. **Loop-scoped outputs are NOT visible outside the loop.** Every action that reads a poll result
   (`{{poll-slug.body...}}`), extract/read, branch, notify, break, MUST live INSIDE the loop
   (`parent_action` = the loop's export_id). An action placed after the loop that references a
   loop-internal output fails to resolve. Read from the POLL response: `poll-slug.body.data.columns`
   (array of `{name}`), `poll-slug.body.data.values` (2D array); count rows with
   `{{Function.JQ(poll-slug.body.data.values, "length", true)}}`, index with
   `{{Function.ACCESS_LIST_ITEM(Function.ACCESS_LIST_ITEM(poll-slug.body.data.values, 0), 0)}}`.
   For a `savelookup` (no results consumed) the loop body is just poll → done-check → break/delay.

**Connection requirement (do not skip):** every SDL HTTP action (launch + poll) must set
`use_authentication_data: true` and be bound to the **"SentinelOne SDL"** connection, which signs
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>`, the auth LRQ requires. The "SentinelOne" mgmt connection signs
`ApiToken` and the SDL endpoints reject it with `HTTP 500 "Header must start with Bearer"`.
Create/verify this connection at Hyperautomation → Integrations → SentinelOne SDL → Add Connection
(Bearer token) BEFORE activating the workflow; activation otherwise fails 400 "requires configuration".

**HEC event-collector ingest is a different credential and a different connection.** A
`POST {HEC_INGEST_URL}/services/collector/event` or `/raw` action takes an **SDL Log Write Key**, not
the console token. A Hyperautomation connection passes its credential through verbatim as
`Authorization: Bearer <value>`, so bind a second Bearer connection whose key value is the Log Write
Key for the target account or site. The console token is refused with `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing
S1-Scope header","code":5}` where the write key returns `HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}`, and
adding an `S1-Scope` header does not fix it. Send no `S1-Scope` header on collector actions: the key
is minted for one account or site and that fixes the destination. `/v1/alerts` on the same host is
the opposite case, see the UAM section below, so do not copy collector auth to it.

## Posting a UAM SecurityAlert from an HA flow that actually SURFACES

Post ONE self-contained alert to `{HEC_INGEST_URL}/v1/alerts` (Bearer + `S1-Scope` headers, using
the console API token, which alert ingest still takes). Embed the indicator inline in
`finding_info.related_events[]`: one round trip, no indicator-registration timing to get wrong.
There is no two-call alternative any more, see below. Fields the stitcher REQUIRES, or you get
HTTP 202 but a SILENT DROP (no alert appears):

- **`class_uid` = `99602001`** ("S1 Security Alert") + `class_name:"S1 Security Alert"`,
  `type_uid:9960200101`, `type_name:"S1 Security Alert: Create"`. **Generic OCSF `class_uid` 2002 is
  silently dropped, this was the actual bug.**
- Top-level **`resources`: [{uid, name, type_id:1, type:"host"}]** (the mapped asset).
- `category_uid:2`, `category_name:"Findings"`, `activity_id:1`, `severity_id`, `state_id:1`,
  `s1_classification_id:1`, `attack_surface_ids:[1]`, top-level `time` (epoch ms).
- `metadata.version:"1.6.0-dev"`, `metadata.extension:{name:"s1",uid:"998",version:"0.1.0"}`,
  `metadata.product:{name,vendor_name}`, `logged_time`, `modified_time`.
- `finding_info:{uid,title,desc,related_events:[...]}`. Each related_event needs `uid, class_uid,
  type_uid, category_uid, activity_id, severity_id, time, message` and `observables[]` (each with
  BOTH `type` AND `typeName`).

**What the related_events entry becomes in the console.** The entry IS the
indicator: `alert.indicators` in UAM GraphQL, which is what the Indicators tab renders, is
populated from `finding_info.related_events[]` with nothing sent to `/v1/indicators`. Per entry:

| related_events field | renders as |
|---|---|
| `title` | `Indicator.title` |
| `desc` | `Indicator.description` |
| `message` | `Indicator.message` |
| `severity_id` | `Indicator.severity`, resolved PER INDICATOR, independent of the alert envelope |
| `observables[]` | `Indicator.observables`, `type_id` mapped to the UI enum (1 HOSTNAME, 2 IP, 4 USER_NAME, 5 EMAIL, 9 PROCESS_NAME, 10 RESOURCE_UID) |

Add `title` and `desc`: without them the indicator renders with a null title and description.
Multiple entries give multiple indicators on one alert. Inline `device` / `actor.user` /
`metadata.profiles` on the entry, and an OCSF `evidences[]` array alongside it, were both tested
and changed nothing, so do not bother carrying them.

**Verify with the right field.** `alert(id){ indicators { type uid title description message
severity observables { name value type } } }`. NOT `alertWithRawIndicators`: `rawIndicators` is a
separate store fed only by `/v1/indicators`, so on this design it stays `[]`, which is expected and
not a failure. Two teams have now chased that empty array as if it were a bug. Do not add `name` or
`category` to that selection set: `Indicator` has neither, and either one fails the whole query with
`Validation error (FieldUndefined@[alert/indicators/name]) : Field 'name' in type 'Indicator' is undefined`.
(`indicator.name` and `indicator.category` are SDL PowerQuery fields on EDR behavioural-indicator
events, an unrelated schema.)

**Indicators cannot be ingested separately at all.** No credential drives `/v1/indicators`: the
console API token that gets `202` from `/v1/alerts` gets `403 "User token not allowed for this
endpoint"` there (it carries the claim `type: "user"`), `ApiToken` is `401` on both, and the SDL
Log Write Key is `401` on both, being a key for the event collector rather than a Bearer JWT for
`/v1/*`. If a flow still has the indicator POST with `continue_on_fail`, every run finishes
`CompletedWithErrors` with `error_actions` empty, which reads as a broken flow and is not one.
Delete the action.

Reference builder: `s1-secops-mcp/lib/uam-ingest.js` `buildSecurityAlert({inline:true})`. The alert
surfaces in UAM ~30-60s after the POST; poll `uam_list_alerts`.

- **Attribution:** for alerts a flow itself raises (e.g. the UEBA SILENT / DORMANT watchdogs), set
  `metadata.product` = `{"name":"Hyperautomation","vendor_name":"SentinelOne"}` so the alert is
  attributed to Hyperautomation in the console rather than to a generic/blank product.

## Detection watchdog pattern (the alternate to a scheduled rule)

Some detection logic cannot run as a PowerQuery **scheduled** Custom Detection rule, because scheduled
rules run on a pre-aggregated data layer where functions like `dataset`, `datasource`, `now`,
`querystart` / `queryend` / `queryspan`, `topK`, `savelookup`, CIDR/wildcard `lookup`, `lookup` over a
>10,000-row table, time-shifted `timebucket`, and `timebucket` < 30s are unavailable (full list in the
`powerquery` skill). The classic case is enumerating **absent** rows, a pair present in a
baseline but with zero events in the live window, which needs a `left join` + `dataset` anti-join.

The **alternate is an HA watchdog**: a scheduled (or manual / run-now) workflow that

1. launches the full PowerQuery as an SDL LRQ (the LRQ runs on raw events, so `left join`, `dataset`,
   `savelookup`, wide/`timebucket`, large `lookup`, etc. all work); see "Running an SDL LRQ from an HA
   flow" above;
2. polls the LRQ to completion and reads back the result rows;
3. posts ONE OCSF SecurityAlert to UAM for the offending rows (or a summary): see "Posting a UAM
   SecurityAlert from an HA flow that actually SURFACES" above; set
   `metadata.product = {"name":"Hyperautomation","vendor_name":"SentinelOne"}` for attribution.

Deploy it active (bind the "SentinelOne SDL" Bearer connection) so the schedule runs it, and/or trigger
it immediately with run-now (`POST .../workflow-execution/manual/{workflow_id}/{version_id}`). The UEBA
**SILENT** (a reliably-active pair goes quiet) and **DORMANT** (a long-idle pair reactivates) detections
are the canonical examples. When several LRQ queries must run and they use `| nolimit`, chain them
**sequentially** (launch, poll to done, then launch the next): only one nolimit query runs per account
at a time.

## Workflow import via s1-secops-mcp

Workflow import, export, and listing use the `s1-secops-mcp` MCP server, which bypasses the
Cowork sandbox proxy entirely. Use `ha_list_workflows`, `ha_get_workflow`, `ha_import_workflow`,
and `ha_export_workflow` directly instead of falling back to the `mgmt-console-api`
skill scripts. The MCP server runs locally on your machine and makes direct HTTPS calls to
`*.sentinelone.net` without proxy interference.

### Deployment gotchas (confirmed 2026-06-11 on <console>)

- **`ha_import_workflow` does not scope to a site.** It posts to `/import` with no `siteIds`, so
  on a site-scoped tenant it returns the misleading `403 "Insufficient permissions"`, not a role
  problem. For a site-scoped deploy, call the REST endpoint directly with the scope param:
  `POST /web/api/v2.1/hyper-automate/api/public/workflow-import-export/import?siteIds=<id>` with
  body `{"data": <workflow>}` (e.g. via the `mgmt-console-api` POST helper). For an
  account-level deploy use the same public endpoint with `?accountIds=<acct>`; the v1
  `/workflow-import-export/import?_scopeId=<acct>&_scopeLevel=account` path returns `403`. Same
  scope rule applies to `activation`, `deactivate`, `publish`, and `DELETE`, append
  `?siteIds=<id>` or `?accountIds=<acct>` to match where the workflow lives.
- **There is no in-place update.** Import always creates a NEW workflow. Re-importing a name that
  already exists succeeds but the console auto-appends `(1)`, `(2)`, … to the name. To "edit" a
  deployed workflow you must delete the old one (REST `DELETE`, see below) and re-import (or edit it
  in the UI).
- **Delete a workflow with a REST `DELETE`.** `DELETE /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}?accountIds=<acct>`
  returns `204` (soft, recoverable delete). Validated end to end (import → publish → delete → gone
  from list). A `404 "Object not found"` on delete means the id is not under that scope (or already
  deleted); match the scope (`?accountIds=`/`?siteIds=`) to where the workflow lives.
- **Publish (share with team) without activating:** `POST /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}/publish`
  (bodyless, scope via `?accountIds=`/`?siteIds=`, returns `204`). This transitions Private Draft to
  Shared Draft, so the flow appears in the team UI in an `inactive` (not-running) state. An imported
  draft is private to the importer until it is published or activated; use publish to hand off a
  reviewed-but-not-yet-runnable workflow, or to surface a draft for deletion.
- **Activation can fail with `400` ("requires configuration" / "invalid references")** when an
  integration-backed action has no bound connection or a placeholder is unresolved. Bind the
  connection (Hyperautomation → Integrations) and set the keys before activating, then `deactivate`
  to leave it published but not running.
