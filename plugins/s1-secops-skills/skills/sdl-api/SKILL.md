  Use whenever the user wants to read data and manage configuration through the SentinelOne Singularity Data Lake (SDL) API: run queries or manage configuration files (parsers, dashboards, alerts, lookups, datatables) on a Scalyr/SDL/XDR tenant. Trigger on "SDL", "SDL API", "Singularity Data Lake", "Scalyr", "DataSet", or any "*.sentinelone.net/sdl/api/*" URL, and on the method names "query", "powerQuery", "facetQuery", "timeseriesQuery", "numericQuery", "configFiles", "configFile", "addConfigFile", "deleteConfigFile", "getFile", "putFile", "listFiles". Also trigger on "udoId", "config file", "/sdl/v2/graphql", or a console display string of the form "/dashboards/id/{number}/{name}". Also trigger on tasks like "run a powerQuery", "list configuration files", "edit my parser via API", "deploy a dashboard JSON", "compute the rate of failures over time", or anything involving SDL Bearer-token auth or the S1-Scope header. Wraps every SDL method with a Python client and CLI.

# SentinelOne SDL API

Wraps the Singularity Data Lake API (query and configuration-file methods) with a pre-built Python client, a CLI runner, and a per-method reference.

The SDL API lives under `<console>/sdl` on the Management Console host. It speaks JSON over `Bearer` tokens (not `ApiToken`) and is the canonical path for querying the data lake and editing parsers/dashboards/alerts/lookups directly. Raw-log ingestion is via HEC (see the `mgmt-console-api` skill).

> **Sandbox proxy blocked?** If calls to `*.sentinelone.net` (SDL host or console host) fail with a connection or proxy error inside the Claude sandbox, use the `s1-secops-mcp` server instead. It runs locally via `node` and bypasses the sandbox proxy entirely. Setup: add it to `claude_desktop_config.json` (see `s1-secops-mcp/README.md`). The MCP server exposes `sdl_list_files`, `sdl_get_file`, `sdl_put_file`, and `sdl_delete_file`, running directly from your machine against the SDL API. Raw-log ingestion uses HEC (see `mgmt-console-api`), not this skill.

## IMPORTANT: query methods are deprecated, and LRQ is NOT available here

The query methods on this skill (`query`, `powerQuery`, `facetQuery`, `timeseriesQuery`, `numericQuery`) wrap the V1 SDL endpoints (`/api/query`, `/api/powerQuery`, etc.) under `<console>/sdl`. Those endpoints are **deprecated and sunset on 2027-02-15** (also applies to the Deep Visibility `/web/api/v2.1/dv/events/pq` endpoint).

**The LRQ API is NOT a replacement available through this skill.** LRQ runs at `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` on the tenant's own **Management Console** host (e.g. `your-tenant.sentinelone.net`); it is part of the Mgmt Console API surface, not the SDL config/query API. To run PowerQueries programmatically, use the **`mgmt-console-api`** skill which holds the LRQ runner, auth pattern, and slicing strategy.

**SDL dashboard panels do not use LRQ either.** Dashboard panel queries are executed by the SDL console's own built-in rendering engine when a user loads the dashboard in their browser. The panel JSON just stores the query string; no API call is needed. Do not attempt to test or run dashboard panel queries via LRQ.

| Task | Correct skill / path |
|------|------|
| PowerQuery programmatically (any range) | **`mgmt-console-api`** → LRQ at `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` on console host |
| Dashboard panel queries | SDL console renders them in-browser: no API needed |
| Quick one-off stats under 24h (deprecated) | V1 methods on this skill still work until 2027-02-15 |
| `get_file` / `put_file` / `list_files` (parsers, dashboards, lookups) | **This skill**, via GraphQL, see below |

## STOP: config files are GraphQL, not the REST `/api/*File` endpoints

`POST /sdl/v2/graphql` is the canonical config-file surface. The legacy REST endpoints
(`/api/listFiles`, `/api/getFile`, `/api/putFile`) are **incomplete** and must not be used to
decide whether a file exists.

Measured live on `<console>`: REST `listFiles` returned **1,914** paths, GraphQL
`configFiles` returned **2,264**. The entire 350-file gap is `/dashboards/` files that carry a
`udoId`, and REST `getFile` on any of them returns `success/noSuchFile`.

**Tripwire, non-negotiable.** If a file is not found by name, or a listing count disagrees with
what the console shows, do **not** conclude the file is absent. The REST listing is incomplete by
design. Re-check with `configFiles` before reporting "not found". A count in the 1,900s when the
console says 2,200-plus means you used the wrong surface.

### The `udoId` rule

The console's Configuration Files grid displays a dashboard as:

```text
/dashboards/id/6554761743556608/AI Usage
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ this is the udoId, NOT a path segment
```

That display string is not a path. Reading it as one returns `no file exists at path`. Pass
`6554761743556608` as `udoId`; the file's real `name` is `/dashboards/AI Usage`.

`udoId` assignment is by **namespace** (verified live): only `/dashboards/` files get one.
`/lookups/`, `/datatables/`, `/logParsers/` and `/automaticLookups` all return `udoId: null` and
are addressed by name.

| Namespace | Address by | Write by name updates in place? |
|---|---|---|
| `/dashboards/` | `udoId` | **No, it creates a duplicate** |
| `/lookups/`, `/datatables/`, `/logParsers/`, `/automaticLookups` | `name` | Yes |

### Never write a dashboard by name

`addConfigFile(name:)` **updates in place** for a name-addressed file but **creates a duplicate**
for a dashboard. Create a dashboard by name once (there is no `udoId` yet), then address it by
`udoId` forever after. Skipping this is how one tenant accumulated **152 copies** of
`/dashboards/AI Usage` and 256 surplus dashboard files overall.

`expectedVersion` is enforced on **both** address forms; a stale value is rejected with
"There are conflicting changes in the file." and the stored content is left untouched. A
`deleteConfigFile` returning `null` with no `errors` array is **success**, not failure.

## Setup: configure credentials first

Drop a `credentials.json` file directly into your Cowork project folder with the keys you need:

```json
{
  "S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN": "eyJ...your-token..."
}
```

The plugin's SessionStart hook auto-discovers the file at the start of every session, so the SDL client picks it up with no preflight. To trigger a manual refresh:

```bash
bash scripts/bootstrap_creds.sh   # idempotent, returns the destination path
```

`S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` authorises every query and config method. Set `SDL_S1_SCOPE` if the token spans multiple sites or accounts. (Legacy alias `SDL_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` is still recognised.)

Environment variables override the credentials file if set.

Before running anything, confirm `S1_CONSOLE_URL` and `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` are set. If not, stop and ask the user to drop `credentials.json` into their Cowork project folder.

## Workflow

When the user asks for something involving the SDL API:

1. **Pick the method.** Check `references/methods.md` for the right call. For **configuration files**, this skill is the right tool, but use the **GraphQL** methods (`config_files`, `config_file`, `put_config_file`, `delete_config_file`), not the legacy REST ones, see the STOP section above and `references/config-file-graphql.md`. Raw-log ingestion is via HEC (see `mgmt-console-api`). For **queries**, use the V1 methods on this skill only for quick one-off stats under 24h; for anything programmatic or multi-day, switch to the **`mgmt-console-api`** skill and the LRQ API, LRQ is NOT available on the SDL config/query surface.
2. **Use the client.** `from sdl_client import SDLClient` then call the named method (`query`, `power_query`, `facet_query`, `timeseries_query`, `numeric_query`, `config_files`, `config_file`, `put_config_file`, `delete_config_file`). The client picks the correct key, handles JSON encoding, retries 429/5xx/`error/server/backoff`, and returns parsed JSON. Note: `query` and `power_query` hit the deprecated V1 endpoints; they work until 2027-02-15 for quick lookups but should not be used for production query pipelines.
3. **For ad-hoc shots, use the CLI.** `python scripts/sdl_cli.py <method> [args]`. The CLI mirrors the client.
4. **Summarize for the user.** Don't dump raw JSON unless asked. For query results, prefer a concise table or CSV; for ingestion, confirm `bytesCharged` and the session ID; for config files, show path + version + (truncated) content.

## Schema discovery: the right way

Every SDL session must run live schema discovery for **every** data source it
will query, including the S1 internal sources `alert`, `vulnerability`,
`misconfiguration`, `asset`, `finding`, `ActivityFeed`, `Identity`, `indicator`
and every third-party source. Documented schemas drift between sessions due to
parser edits, reserved-field rewrites, and ingestion changes.

**`asset` and `ActivityFeed`, confirmed live schemas (126 and 41 fields respectively):**

- `dataSource.name='asset'`: **126 fields of rich device inventory** (OCSF class_uid 3004, category_name = 'Discovery'). Key fields: `device.agent.uuid`, `device.name`, `device.os.{name,version,type}`, `device.agent.{network_status,network_status_title,network_quarantine_enabled,is_active,is_decommissioned,is_uninstalled,scan_status,version,last_logged_in_user_name}`, `device.ip_external`, `device.hw_info.*`, `device.network_interfaces[N].*`, `severity_id`, `severity_`, `operation` (= OPERATION_UPSERT), `s1_metadata.{site_id,site_name,group_id,group_name}`. Use this for endpoint inventory panels and asset state tracking. Fields that do **not** exist: `entity.uid`, `entity_result.*`, `agent.health.online`, `agent.uuid` (use `device.agent.uuid`).
- `dataSource.name='ActivityFeed'`: **41 fields of Hyperautomation/management activity audit log** (`sca:RetentionType = 'ACTIVITY_LOG'`). Key fields: `activity_type` (numeric, NOT a string, e.g. 9207 = workflow execution event), `activity_uuid`, `primary_description`, `secondary_description`, `data.workflow_{id,name,execution_url}`, `data.{scope_id,scope_level,scope_name,site_name,user_id}`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `account.{id,name}`, `site_id`, `context`. Useful for Hyperautomation workflow audit and compliance tracking. Not useful for threat hunting.

**The actual ingestion pipeline metrics source is `finding`** (`dataSource.category='metrics'`, `tag='ingestionHealth'`, fields: `batchCt`, `eventLatency.*`, `processor`, etc.); do not confuse it with `asset` or `ActivityFeed`.

**Why PowerQuery is the wrong tool for this:** PowerQuery's default projection
returns `timestamp + message` only. Naive `dataSource.name='alert' | limit 1`
hides the actual fields. `| columns *` returns HTTP 500. You can probe specific
fields with `| columns f1, f2` but you have to already know what to ask for,
which defeats the purpose of discovery.

**Use the V1 `query` method instead.** It returns each match as the full event
JSON with every populated attribute keyed in an `attributes` dict. That's the
only built-in way to see what fields a source actually carries.

`SDLClient` authenticates every method with `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, which
carries Log Read as well as config permissions, so no per-method credential
selection is needed.

```python
from sdl_client import SDLClient
c = SDLClient()

schemas = {}
for source in all_sources_from_step1_enumeration:
    res = c.query(filter=f"dataSource.name=='{source}'", max_count=2, start_time="24h")
    matches = res.get("matches") or []
    if not matches:
        continue
    attrs = matches[0].get("attributes") or {}
    schemas[source] = sorted(attrs.keys())

import json, datetime
out = f"outputs/sdl_schemas_{datetime.date.today().isoformat()}.json"
json.dump(schemas, open(out, "w"), indent=2)
```

**Direct MCP tools bypass sandbox proxy entirely.**

The Cowork sandboxed shell blocks all outbound HTTPS to `*.sentinelone.net`. Use the
s1-secops-mcp MCP tools instead, which run locally and bypass the proxy:

| Operation | s1-secops-mcp tool |
|---|---|
| PowerQuery | `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__powerquery_run` or `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__powerquery_schema_discover` |
| `put_file` / `get_file` / `list_files` | `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_put_file`, `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_get_file`, `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_list_files` |

All of these tools run on your local machine and make direct HTTPS calls to the console host
without sandbox proxy interference. No fallback or workaround needed.

```python
# Example: use sdl_get_file MCP tool directly instead
import sys, subprocess, json
result = subprocess.run(["mdfind", "-name", "sdl_client.py"], capture_output=True, text=True)
sdk_dir = [p for p in result.stdout.strip().split("\n") if "claude-skills" in p][0].rsplit("/", 1)[0]
sys.path.insert(0, sdk_dir)
from sdl_client import SDLClient
c = SDLClient()
# SDLClient.query(...) / put_file(...) / get_file(...) here
```

A proxy error treated as an empty result produces a fabricated schema, causing every downstream panel to silently query non-existent fields.

The `attributes` dict exposes nested arrays as flattened keys like
`resources[0].name` and `vulnerabilities[0].cve.uid`. Those flattened keys are
display-only; they are NOT valid PowerQuery `columns` paths. PowerQuery
returns HTTP 500 on bracket-array indexing. For analytics over array fields,
either stay on V1 query or use `array_get(arr, 0)` inside a PowerQuery `let`.

**Trailing-underscore reserved-field rule:** Field names ending in `_`
(`severity_`, `status_`, `classification_`) are SDL's auto-rename when source
data carries a field colliding with an SDL reserved name. The underscored form
IS the canonical, queryable field. Numeric OCSF variants (`severity_id` 0-5,
`status_id`, `class_uid`) live alongside the underscored string fields.
Prefer numeric OCSF for filters; the string `severity_` is case-mixed
(`Critical` and `CRITICAL` co-exist) and will produce split columns in
`transpose`.

## Raw log ingestion, simulating events for detection testing

Raw-log ingestion runs through the event collector (the `hec_ingest` tool; `POST {S1_HEC_INGEST_URL}/services/collector/raw` and `/event`).

**Auth is an SDL Log Write Key, carried in `S1_HEC_TOKEN`.** The Management Console API token, service user or personal, is refused: on identical requests the write key returns `HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}` and the console token returns `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}`. Mint the key at Console > Singularity Data Lake > API Keys > Log Write Key; no API creates one. It is optional in config because only log ingest needs it.

**The ingest scope cannot be overridden.** A Log Write Key is minted for exactly one account or site and writes only there, so the key itself fixes the destination. No `S1-Scope` header is sent for log ingest, and sending one has no effect. To write elsewhere, use a key minted for that scope.

UAM alert ingest (`POST /v1/alerts` on the same host) and IOCs are a different path and still use the console API token (`S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`); that client is documented with `mgmt-console-api`.

When injecting events into the data lake to validate a detection, these behaviours are confirmed live:

- **Use flat dotted keys, not nested JSON.** With `/event?isParsed=true`, nested OCSF such as `{"event":{"category":"firewall"}}` dropped `event.category` (read back null, since `event.*` is a reserved namespace). The flat key `{"event.category":"firewall"}` landed correctly. Flat dotted keys reliably populate arbitrary OCSF fields (`src.ip.address`, `dst.ip.address`, `threat.category`, ...) and even EDR-style S1QL column names (`EventType`, `TgtProcName`, `LogonResult`) as literal, queryable attributes. `dataSource.name` / `.category` / `.vendor` set via flat keys stick (e.g. `dataSource.category` stays `security`).
- **HEC data can drive all three custom-rule types.** On an AI-SIEM tenant, `events` and `correlation` STAR rules evaluate HEC-ingested data (both fired from HEC events in testing), not only EDR-agent telemetry, and `scheduled` PowerQuery rules run over the same data lake. So HEC ingest of flat-key events is a working way to end-to-end test any of the three custom detection rule types. See the Detection-as-Code playbook in `sdl-solutions`.

## Files in this skill

- `scripts/bootstrap_creds.sh`: idempotent helper that copies workspace creds into the sandbox-local path. Wired to the plugin's SessionStart hook; safe to re-run manually.
- `scripts/sdl_client.py`: importable Python client (`SDLClient`). Picks the right key per method, retries with exponential backoff, exposes ergonomic method names.
- `scripts/sdl_cli.py`: CLI runner: `python scripts/sdl_cli.py power-query "dataset='accesslog' | group count() by status" --start 1h`.
- `references/methods.md`: single per-method reference (parameters, defaults, response shape, gotchas) for the SDL query and configuration-file endpoints.
- `references/auth_and_limits.md`: key matrix, console-token rules, S1-Scope, leaky-bucket CPU rate-limit model, retry guidance, daily caps.

## Using the client

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from sdl_client import SDLClient

c = SDLClient()

# ---- Log read ----
# PowerQuery: best general-purpose tool
res = c.power_query(
    query="dataset='accesslog' status >= 400 | group count() by status",
    start_time="1h",
)
# res = {"status": "success", "matchingEvents": ..., "columns": [...], "values": [[...], ...]}

# Raw event search
matches = list(c.iter_query(filter="error", start_time="15m", max_total=500))

# Top-N values
top_ips = c.facet_query(field="srcIp", filter="status >= 400", start_time="24h", max_count=20)

# Numeric / timeseries (1 query)
ts = c.timeseries_query(queries=[
    {"filter": "serverHost contains 'frontend'", "function": "count", "startTime": "1h", "buckets": 60}
])

# ---- Configuration files (GraphQL) ----
# Parsers live under /logParsers/<name>: the SDL API also accepts /parsers/<name>
# but the Log Parsers UI only reads /logParsers/, so writes at /parsers/ are invisible
# in the console. Use /logParsers/<name> by default.
files = c.config_files()                      # [{"udoId":..., "name":"/foo", "version":7}, ...]

# Name-addressed files (/logParsers/, /lookups/, /datatables/, /automaticLookups)
parser = c.config_file(name="/logParsers/MyParser")   # {"name":..., "content":"...", "version":7, ...}
c.put_config_file(name="/logParsers/MyParser", content="// new parser body",
                  expected_version=parser["version"])
c.delete_config_file(name="/logParsers/Stale", expected_version=7)

# Dashboards are addressed by udoId: a name-addressed write creates a duplicate
dash = c.config_file(udo_id="96200328708096")
c.put_config_file(udo_id=dash["udoId"], content=new_dashboard_json,
                  expected_version=dash["version"])
```

## Authentication

Every request sets `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The client picks the key per method using these chains (first non-empty wins):

Every method authenticates with `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`.

If a `console_api_token` is used and the user has access to multiple sites or accounts, set `s1_scope` (e.g. `"<account_id>:<site_id>"` for site scope, `"<account_id>"` for account scope). The client adds `S1-Scope` automatically when both conditions hold.

A 401 with `error/client/noPermission` means the token is wrong or expired. SDL keys do not expire by default, but console user tokens do.

## Rate limits and retries

The client retries automatically on HTTP 429, 5xx, and SDL `status: error/server/backoff` (which can come back inside a 200), honouring `Retry-After`. Things to know up-front:

- **Query budget is a leaky bucket of CPU seconds.** When `cpuUsageSecondsToWait` shows in a 429, back off by that many seconds. `priority: "low"` (the default) gets a more generous bucket than `"high"`. See `references/auth_and_limits.md` for the bucket model.
- **From 19 March 2026, all query methods cap at 8 queries/sec per tenant.**
- **Concurrency cap:** 12 simultaneous requests per API key (non-query). For loops, throttle in code.

For long-running ingest, use the binary truncated exponential backoff loop in `references/integration_patterns.md` rather than the client's default retries; it is designed to stop on `discardBuffer` and to slowly relax wait times after success.

## Destructive actions: confirm first

`delete_config_file(...)` and `put_config_file(content=...)` overwriting an existing file can wipe a parser, dashboard, alert, or lookup table. Before any config-file write or delete:

- Run `config_file(...)` first to read current `version` and content. Pass that version as `expected_version` on the write to fail-fast on a concurrent edit; a stale value is rejected with "There are conflicting changes in the file." on both address forms.
- Address a dashboard by `udo_id`. A name-addressed write to an existing `/dashboards/` file creates a duplicate rather than updating it.
- For deletes, summarise the file name (and `udoId` for a dashboard) and get explicit confirmation. A `delete_config_file` returning `null` with no `errors` array is success.
- Keep a backup in the working directory before overwriting non-trivial parsers or dashboards.

There is no undo. Configuration files are versioned but accidental deletes still take effect immediately.

## Common high-value workflows

- **Hunt with PowerQuery.** Use the **`mgmt-console-api`** skill, which holds the LRQ runner at `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` on your console host. LRQ is NOT reachable via the SDL API (`xdr.<region>.sentinelone.net`). This skill's `c.power_query()` hits the deprecated V1 endpoint and should only be used for a quick ad-hoc one-off before 2027-02-15.
- **Promote a parser/dashboard.** `config_file(name="/logParsers/Foo")` from staging → `put_config_file(name="/logParsers/Foo", content=..., expected_version=N)` on production. The `expected_version` guard catches concurrent edits. (Parser path is `/logParsers/`, `/parsers/` is API-accepted but not UI-visible.) Promote a dashboard by `udo_id` on the target tenant, creating it by name only the first time.
- **Audit configuration drift.** `config_files()` then `config_file(name=...)` for each name-addressed file and `config_file(udo_id=...)` for each dashboard; diff against a checked-in copy.
- **Quick stats panel.** `facet_query(field="srcIp", filter="status >= 500", start_time="1h")` returns the top offenders fast.

For complex hunts and detection authoring use the `powerquery` skill for the query body, then call `c.power_query()` from this skill to execute it. For Mgmt Console resources (agents, threats, sites) use `mgmt-console-api`.

## Using s1-secops-mcp tools for direct SDL operations

If a direct bash call to sdl_client.py fails with a proxy error, use the s1-secops-mcp MCP
tools instead. They run on your local machine and bypass the sandbox proxy entirely:

- `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_get_file` for reading SDL configuration files
- `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_put_file` for deploying parsers, dashboards, alerts, lookups
- `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__sdl_list_files` for listing SDL configuration inventory
- `mcp__s1-secops-mcp__powerquery_run` for executing PowerQueries against the Singularity Data Lake

No Desktop Commander workaround is necessary when you use these tools.

This is not a credential issue. Do not widen time windows or change query logic to debug this.

## Raw log ingest (learnings)

- **Auth is the SDL Log Write Key (`S1_HEC_TOKEN`), and the key fixes the scope.** The console API token is refused, `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}` against the write key's `HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}`. A key writes only to the account or site it was minted for; no header overrides that. See "Raw log ingestion" above.
- **Three mandatory attributes for the XDR / OCSF view:** `dataSource.name`, `dataSource.vendor`, `dataSource.category`. Set all three as query params on `POST {HEC}/services/collector/event?isParsed=true&dataSource.name=...&dataSource.vendor=...&dataSource.category=...`. With only `dataSource.name` the events land under **All Data** but are invisible under the **XDR** view (XDR-scoped dashboards and rules show nothing, while all-data API queries still return them).
- **`dataSource.category` MUST be hard-coded to `security`. Do not derive it from the event's OCSF semantics.** This attribute is the ingestion routing category that places the event in the XDR / OCSF security pipeline where detections, STAR/scheduled rules, and Singularity Threat Intelligence IOC matching run. It is NOT the OCSF event category. Setting it from the log type (e.g. `network` for a firewall, `identity` for auth logs, `cloud` for CloudTrail) lands the event under All Data only: it stays fully queryable via all-data PowerQuery, but the security pipeline never evaluates it, so XDR detections and Threat Intelligence matches silently never fire. Always send `dataSource.category=security`. The OCSF `category_uid` / `category_name` inside the event body (e.g. `4` / `Network Activity` for a firewall) is a separate field and stays true to the event; only the ingest-time `dataSource.category` query param is pinned to `security`. Confirmed failure mode (2026-07): a Palo Alto OCSF event ingested with `dataSource.category=network` was queryable under All Data but produced no Threat Intelligence match; the fix is `dataSource.category=security`.
- **Singularity Threat Intelligence IOC matching, ingest requirements:** for a HEC-ingested OCSF event to be eligible for a TI match it must (1) carry `metadata.version` with any non-empty value, this is the only "is OCSF" check the TI engine performs, it does NOT validate the full OCSF schema; (2) be ingested with `dataSource.category=security` (see above); and (3) carry the IOC value in the OCSF field the engine matches on, for an IP IOC that is `src_endpoint.ip` (also checks `dst_endpoint.ip`). A match generates a NEW event with `dataSource.name='Threat Intelligence'` and `metadata.labels[0]='s1_threat_intelligence_indicator'`; the event Name is the source data-source name. Matching is asynchronous, allow several minutes before querying for the match log.
- **Backdating:** a top-level `time` field in **epoch SECONDS** backdates the event; a nested `event.time` (ms) does NOT. `isParsed=true` indexes the JSON keys directly as top-level attributes, so the field names you ingest are the field names you query (source-agnostic, no OCSF mapping needed).
- **Query-time timestamp:** on HEC `isParsed` events `event.time` is NOT populated; the queryable event time is `timestamp` (epoch NANOSECONDS). Use `timestamp` for `newest()/oldest()`, `strftime()` hour-of-day, and time math; convert to ms with `number(ts)/1000000`.
- **⚠ Back-dated events ALSO produce receive-time "shadow" copies. Known platform defect, do not go looking for a bug in your ingest code.** A POST with a back-dated top-level `time` indexes correctly at the requested timestamp AND writes one or more extra copies stamped at ingest time. The shadows carry the URL-supplied `dataSource.name` / `dataSource.vendor` but NOT the JSON body fields, so they are invisible to `field = *` filters and show up only in unfiltered counts. Full reproduction and impact analysis: `SUPPORT_TICKET_HEC_shadow_copies.md` at the repo root (observed 2026-07-29, re-confirmed 2026-08-09).

  Consequences when building synthetic test data:
  - Any count over a window that spans "now" is inflated. Volume baselines, ingest-health analytics and dashboards summing across the ingest moment double-count.
  - A source you deliberately left EMPTY in the live window will not read as empty, so a detection requiring zero live events (e.g. a SILENT / anti-join watchdog) cannot be validated this way.
  - Scale seen: a source sent 430 back-dated events and nothing live read ~500 events in the trailing 24h. It is not proportional to batch size and is unaffected by payload shape.
  - **Already eliminated as causes, do not re-test these:** envelope vs flat payload, `isParsed` on/off, chunk size (100 vs 500), run-tag field name, timestamp recency, and same-source vs cross-source concurrency. All four payload forms behave identically.
  - Workaround for assertions: tag every event you post and count with `<tag> = *`, which excludes shadows because they carry no body fields. Only use unfiltered counts when you specifically need what a DETECTION sees, and expect them to be inflated.
