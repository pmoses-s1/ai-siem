# SDL API method reference

Every method is a JSON `POST` to `{base_url}/api/<method>` unless noted, where
`base_url` is `<console>/sdl`, derived from `S1_CONSOLE_URL`. All
requests send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `Content-Type: application/json`. The `status` property of every
response uses a slash-delimited hierarchy; `success` prefix = OK,
`error/client` prefix = caller bug, `error/server` prefix = retry.

The rows below refer to client methods on `SDLClient` (in `scripts/sdl_client.py`)
and CLI subcommands (in `scripts/sdl_cli.py`).

## Ingestion (moved to HEC)

SDL raw-log ingestion (`uploadLogs`, `addEvents`) has been removed from this skill. Ingest raw logs/events via the **event collector** on the ingest host (`/services/collector/raw` and `/event`, with a named `parser`), which feeds Event Search, PowerQuery, and detection rules. That path authenticates with an SDL Log Write Key (`S1_HEC_TOKEN`), not the console API token, and the key's own scope fixes the ingest destination. UAM alert creation is separate: it lives in `mgmt-console-api` (`uam_*`, posted to `/v1/alerts` on the same host but a distinct API, still using the console API token), and indicators ride inline in the alert rather than having an endpoint of their own. This skill now covers queries and configuration files only.

## Log read (queries)

All five methods consume the CPU leaky bucket described in `auth_and_limits.md`.
`cpuUsage` is returned on success as a rate-limiting signal.

### `query`: `c.query(filter="", ...)` / `c.iter_query(...)`, CLI `query`

**DEPRECATED.** The V1 `/api/query` endpoint sunsets on 2027-02-15. For log search in new code use the LRQ API with `queryType: "LOG"` - async, cursor-paged to unlimited rows, survives long windows. See the `powerquery` skill's `references/lrq-api.md`. This method is fine for legacy one-offs until the sunset date.

Event search. Filter syntax matches the UI search bar.

Params:

- `filter` (string): search expression (e.g. `status >= 400 status < 500`). Escape `"` with `\"` when embedding in JSON.
- `startTime` / `endTime`: UI time syntax (`"1h"`, `"24h"`, `"10/27 4 PM"`) or epoch sec/ms/ns. `startTime` inclusive, `endTime` exclusive. Omit both for past 24h.
- `maxCount`: 1..5000, default 100.
- `pageMode`: `head` (oldest first) | `tail` (newest first).
- `columns`: comma-separated field allow-list to shrink response.
- `continuationToken`: page beyond maxCount; pass the token from the previous response. Pin start/end to absolute times when paging to avoid drift.
- `priority`: `low` (default, generous bucket) | `high` (stricter).
- `teamEmails` / `tenant` / `accountIds`: cross-team/multi-account (console tokens only for `tenant`/`accountIds`).

Response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "matches": [
    {"timestamp": "nanoseconds", "message": "...", "severity": 3, "session": "...", "thread": "...", "attributes": {...}}
  ],
  "sessions": {"sessionId": {"serverHost": "...", ...}},
  "cpuUsage": 12,
  "continuationToken": "..."
}
```

`matches` is ascending by timestamp regardless of pageMode. A `continuationToken` can appear even when no more matches exist.

Use `c.iter_query(...)` to iterate across pages automatically.

---

### `powerQuery`: `c.power_query(query, ...)`, CLI `power-query`

**DEPRECATED.** The V1 `/api/powerQuery` endpoint at `xdr.<region>.sentinelone.net` sunsets on 2027-02-15. New code should route PowerQueries through the **Long Running Query API** at `POST /sdl/v2/api/queries` on the tenant's own console host. LRQ is async, has higher row/rate limits, parallelizes cleanly across time slices, and is the only path that stays supported after the sunset date. Canonical runner, body schema, auth, and gotchas live in the `powerquery` skill at `references/lrq-api.md`. This method is kept here only for legacy one-offs and to round out the 10-method SDL surface.

Full pipeline query language (S1QL-style). `query` is limited to 10K chars; escape `"` with `\"`.

Times default to past 24h if both omitted.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "matchingEvents": 123,
  "omittedEvents": 0,
  "columns": [{"name": "col1"}, {"name": "col2"}],
  "values": [[v1, v2], [v1, v2]]
}
```

Cells may be `null`, `true`, `false`, number, string, or `{"special": "+infinity"|"-infinity"|"NaN"}`.

PQ extends with `datasource` (from S-24.2.6) to read outside Singularity, e.g. `| datasource "metering" from "reports"` for Usage Metering tables (`tenants`, `reports`, `report_name`).

#### Usage Metering reports

Usage Metering (cost / usage / MSSP chargeback) is reached through the `datasource "metering"` generator, not a dedicated REST endpoint. Source: Community article 000010750, supported from S-24.2.6.

- **Permission:** `Metering Reports - View` is required (default on C-Level and Admin roles; can be added to custom roles). Without it the query returns no data.
- **Datasets:** `tenants` (visible tenants), `reports` (available report names + metadata), and `<report_name>` for raw rows of one report (e.g. `server_endpoints`). List names via `from "reports"` before querying a specific report.
- **Run it through LRQ, not the deprecated path.** The Community doc shows `POST /sdl/api/powerQuery`, which is the V1 endpoint that sunsets 2027-02-15. The `datasource` generator works in any PQ runner, so route metering queries through the Long Running Query API (`POST /sdl/v2/api/queries`, `queryType: "PQ"`, query in `pq.query`) like every other PowerQuery in this skill.
- **Rate limit:** metering datasource calls are capped at **50 rps with a 100-request burst** (see `auth_and_limits.md`).
- **Drilldown filter:** append normal PQ to post-process the returned rows:

```text
| datasource "metering" from "server_endpoints" | filter endpoint_bundle in ('Core', 'Complete')
```

Key response columns include `calculation_time`, `date`, `timestamp`, `Console_id/hostname`, `Account_scope_*`, `Site_scope_*`, `tenant_scope_*`, `tenant_id/name`, the `organization_level_{0,1,2}_*` hierarchy, `environment`, `cloud_region`, `cloud_provider`, plus report-specific fields. Full column reference and authoring help: the `powerquery` skill, `references/datasource-command.md`.

For query authoring, use the `powerquery` skill, it knows the
field taxonomy and pipe grammar.

### `facetQuery`: `c.facet_query(field, ...)`, CLI `facet-query`

Top-N most frequent values of `field` for events matching `filter`.

Params: `field` (required), `filter` (optional), `startTime` (required), `endTime`, `maxCount` (1..1000, default 100), `priority`.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "values": [{"value": "...", "count": 100}, ...],
  "matchCount": 1000,
  "cpuUsage": 12
}
```

`values` is sorted by count desc. For very large result sets, values are a sampled
subset from at least 500K matching events.

---

### `timeseriesQuery`: `c.timeseries_query(queries=[...])`, CLI `timeseries-query`

Bucketed numeric data; multi-query per request. Each entry in `queries` may
include: `filter`, `function` (`count` | `rate` | `mean(field)` | ...),
`startTime`, `endTime`, `buckets`, `createSummaries`, `onlyUseSummaries`,
`priority`, plus cross-team fields.

`createSummaries` (default `true`): create a precomputed timeseries for this
query. Backfill begins in 2-3 minutes, ~2 months/hour. Subsequent matching
queries become near-instant.

`onlyUseSummaries` (default `false`): fail over to zeros if no precomputed
series exists, guarantees fast/cheap response but may be incomplete until
backfill finishes.

Novel query budget: >100 novel (uncached) queries/hour triggers rate limits.
Using `* contains` / `* matches` to scan all fields is not optimised.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "results": [
    {"values": [n, n, n], "cpuUsage": 5, "foundExistingSeries": true}
  ]
}
```

`values.length == buckets`; a value is `null` if undefined (e.g. mean over an empty bucket).

---

### `numericQuery`: `c.numeric_query(...)`, CLI `numeric-query`

Effectively superseded by `timeseriesQuery` with `createSummaries=false` and
`onlyUseSummaries=false`. Keep it for two reasons:

1. Users whose role cannot call timeseriesQuery can still call this.
2. Sub-30-second bucket granularity (timeseries min is 30s).

Params: `function` (required; `count` | `rate` | aggregation), `filter`,
`startTime` (required), `endTime`, `buckets` (1..5000, default 1), `priority`.

Response: `{"status": "success", "values": [n, n, ...], "cpuUsage": 12}`.
`values.length == buckets`.

## Configuration files

Config files back every SDL customisation: parsers, dashboards, alerts,
lookups, datatables. Paths look like `/logParsers/Foo`, `/dashboards/Bar`,
`/alerts`, etc. Parsers specifically must use `/logParsers/<name>`;
the API also accepts `/parsers/<name>` but the Log Parsers UI reads only `/logParsers/`.

> **Warning: `listFiles`, `getFile` and `putFile` are legacy and incomplete.**
> These three REST methods omit every udoId-addressed `/dashboards/` file.
> Measured live on `<console>`: REST `listFiles` returned **1,914** paths
> against GraphQL `configFiles`' **2,264**, and REST `getFile` on any file in
> that 350-file gap returns `success/noSuchFile`. **A `noSuchFile` response is
> not proof that a file is absent.** Use the GraphQL surface for all
> configuration-file work: `configFiles`, `configFile`, `addConfigFile` and
> `deleteConfigFile` at `POST <console>/sdl/v2/graphql`, exposed on the client
> as `config_files()`, `config_file()`, `put_config_file()` and
> `delete_config_file()`. Full reference: `references/config-file-graphql.md`.

### `listFiles`: `c.list_files()`, CLI `list-files`

No params. Returns `{"status":"success","paths":["/a","/b/c","/z"]}` sorted
alphabetically.

### `getFile`: `c.get_file(path, expected_version=None, prettyprint=False)`, CLI `get-file`

Reads a single file. Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "path": "...",
  "version": 7,
  "createDate": 1700000000,
  "modDate": 1700000100,
  "content": "...",
  "stalenessSlop": 0
}
```

- If the file does not exist: `{"status":"success/noSuchFile"}`.
- If `expected_version` matches current: `{"status":"success/unchanged"}` with no `content`.

### `putFile`: `c.put_file(path, content=None, delete=False, expected_version=None, prettyprint=False)`, CLI `put-file`

Create, update, or delete. `delete=True` uses `{"deleteFile": true}` internally.

Content validation depends on file type, dashboards expect `"{graphs: []}"`
as empty, parsers/datatables expect empty string. Pass a fresh `expected_version`
from the preceding `getFile` for optimistic concurrency; a mismatch returns
`{"status":"error/client/versionMismatch"}` and no write.

Response on success: `{"status":"success"}`.

Authorisation is `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
The scoped SDL keys are retired; the console token covers every SDL operation.
Console tokens are scope-aware, so the `S1-Scope` header may be required on the
REST endpoints.
