# Alert 1770000000000000002 - FIN-WKS-0042

**SUSPICIOUS - Pending Confirmation, single weak signal.** I am not opening a P1 on this yet.

## Why the ceiling is Pending Confirmation

A detection is a hypothesis, not a conclusion. The CRITICAL label is the Behavioural AI
engine's view of the threat class, and the verdict gate requires at least one of a
threat-intel malicious verdict, an MDR or analyst confirmation, or the same indicator
corroborated across two independent sources. None is present:

- External enrichment is opt-in and you declined it for this tenant, so it was skipped
  and no indicator left SentinelOne. That is a deliberate gap, recorded, not an oversight.
- `get_alert_notes` and `get_alert_history` both return empty. No MDR verdict exists.
- One engine firing once is not multi-source corroboration.

Asset criticality (a finance workstation) raises the priority of the next collection step.
It is not a substitute for a confirmation gate, and it cannot lift the verdict on its own.
