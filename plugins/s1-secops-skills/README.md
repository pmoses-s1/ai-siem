# SentinelOne AI Analyst: Claude Skills

A full-stack AI analyst for SentinelOne, built as a set of Claude skills, three MCP servers, and an operating persona (CLAUDE.md). Install once and Claude can hunt threats, triage alerts, write detections, deploy dashboards, author parsers, and build automation workflows, entirely from natural language.

> **Fastest way to get started: [Quick start (Docker)](#1-quick-start-docker).** One image bundles all three MCPs, no host-level Node, Python, or `uv` required. Pull, paste a config block, install the plugin, done. See [Installation](#installation) for all three install paths.
>
> **New here?** Start with the [Zero to Hero guide](./docs/zero-to-hero.md): a 20-minute onboarding walkthrough for customers and partners new to Claude Skills.

> **Contributing a fix to a skill? Read this first.** Everything under `skills/` and `../../mcp/s1-secops-mcp/` is **mirrored from the upstream `claude-skills` repo** by a sync script. A change made only here is silently overwritten by the next sync. Fix it upstream in `claude-skills` and let the sync carry it, or open an issue and say what needs changing. Docs under `docs/` and this README are maintained here and are safe to edit directly.

## Architecture overview

The layers work together top-down. CLAUDE.md is the main instruction layer and decides what to do; it invokes skills as needed. For a whole-solution request the `sdl-solutions` umbrella skill runs first and orchestrates the primitive skills; the skills then reach live APIs through the MCP servers.

```
CLAUDE.md                  Main instruction layer: SOC Analyst persona, session protocol,
                           evidence rules, investigation workflow, classification gates.
                           Decides what to do and invokes skills as needed.

                           solution" request it runs first, collects parameters, previews,

  threat-intel-mcp           External IOC enrichment (required for CRITICAL classification)
```

**CLAUDE.md** is the brain: it sets the operating persona and invokes skills as the task demands. **sdl-solutions** is the umbrella skill: for whole-solution work it runs first and orchestrates the primitive skills (PowerQuery, dashboard, parser, Hyperautomation, SDL API, Mgmt Console) in order, previewing before it deploys. **Skills** encode confirmed API behaviour, including field schemas validated against live tenants, so Claude doesn't guess field names, and they reach `*.sentinelone.net` through the **MCP servers**, which bypass the Cowork sandbox proxy. For a single query, dashboard, parser, or workflow, Claude calls the matching primitive skill directly without the umbrella.

## What's included

The plugin bundles every skill; installing it is sufficient. No individual skill setup needed.

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| mgmt-console-api | Query and act on the Management Console: threats, alerts, agents, sites, RemoteOps, Deep Visibility, Hyperautomation, Purple AI, UAM. Includes the source-agnostic behavioural baselining + anomaly detection pipeline (`baseline_anomaly.py`) |
| powerquery | Write, debug, and run PowerQuery for threat hunting, STAR detection rules, SDL dashboards, and statistical baseline / anomaly detection rule bodies |
| sdl-api | Ingest events, run queries, and manage configuration files (parsers, dashboards, lookups) via the Singularity Data Lake API |
| sdl-dashboard | Design, author, and deploy SDL dashboards: panels, tabs, parameters, and full dashboard JSON. See [docs/sdl-dashboard.md](./docs/sdl-dashboard.md) for all supported panel types |
| sdl-log-parser | Author and validate SDL log parsers for any log format, with OCSF field mapping by default |
| hyperautomation | Design and generate Hyperautomation workflow JSON, with optional live console import |
| sdl-solutions | Deploy packaged, repeatable SDL solutions into a customer site from one short prompt: data source onboarding (raw stream to OCSF + enrichment + dashboard + MITRE detections + threat-response flow) , asset enrichment of raw logs (device/user context from the Asset Inventory), UEBA behavioural anomaly detection (z-score baselining of any signal), per-device ingest health monitoring (anomaly detection on a 7-day hour-of-day baseline: volume spike/drop, ingest lag, ingest loss, and parser drift, with a dashboard and email notifications), detection exclusions, Risk-Based Alerting, and Detection as Code (author rules as TOML in Git and sync them to the Custom Detection API via CI), and alert noise reduction (find and quiet the sources flooding the alert queue: an ingestion-filter recommendation, an auto-resolve flow, and a noise-vs-signal dashboard). Orchestrates the skills above |
| soc-investigator | Autonomous, staged DFIR investigation of SentinelOne alerts (SHORT / MEDIUM / LONG modes) with tool discovery, intake, IOC enrichment, per-endpoint PowerQuery forensics, optional third-party correlation and anomaly detection, and the SOC Analyst evidence-discipline and verdict gates. Authored by Joel Mora |

## PrincipalSOCAnalyst Project

`CLAUDE.md` at the root of this repo transforms Claude into a **Principal SOC Analyst**: a structured investigator that runs the same enrichment, correlation, and reasoning process a senior analyst would, on every alert, every time. Set it up once as a named Cowork project and every session starts fully briefed.

### What it delivers

| Outcome | How |
|---|---|
| **Reduce L1 SOC workload by 70%+** | Automated triage, mandatory threat-intel enrichment on every IOC, and verdict generation eliminate repetitive alert investigation. L1 analysts focus on exceptions, not routine. |
| **Elevate every analyst to principal grade** | Junior analysts get the same structured investigation framework, enrichment depth, and analytical reasoning that only senior staff possess today. |
| **External threat intelligence on every IOC** | Mandatory enrichment of every IP, domain, hash, and URL through the configured threat-intel MCP. The default bundle ships VirusTotal (70+ AV engines, threat-actor attribution, full infrastructure mapping); swap in any equivalent provider (Recorded Future, Mandiant Advantage, OpenCTI, MISP, etc.) and the workflow is unchanged. |
| **Mean investigation time under 5 minutes** | Investigation workflows that take 45-60 minutes manually compress to under 5 minutes. Continuous hunting catches threats between analyst shifts. |
| **Full data estate coverage** | Queries OCSF-normalised logs, non-OCSF vendor logs, and raw syslog. Discovers field schemas dynamically at session start, with no hardcoded assumptions about what sources are present. |
| **Fast-track detection creation** | Natural language detection authoring across any data source. Recommends new STAR rules and custom detections as threats are identified during investigation. |
| **Deliver the capability today** | Purple AI becomes even more powerful when orchestrated through this multi-layer architecture, combining deep enrichment, cross-source correlation, and external threat intelligence in every investigation. |
| **Federated search across the data estate** | Search, correlate, and hunt across endpoint, network, identity, and cloud log sources via MCP/API in a single session. Cross-source correlation connects signals that are invisible in any one source. |
| **Every alert arrives with business context** | Asset and identity enrichment attaches device role, criticality, and account context to each alert automatically, so the queue self-prioritises by business impact. A medium on a domain controller outranks a critical on a sandbox, with no manual lookup. |
| **New detections the same day a threat emerges** | When a new TTP or campaign breaks, its behaviour is turned into a validated, MITRE-mapped PowerQuery or STAR detection and deployed in hours, not the weeks a hand-authored rule normally takes. |
| **Onboard any new data source in minutes** | A raw, unreadable stream becomes OCSF-normalised, parsed, dashboarded, and detection-covered in a single session. Coverage stops being gated by quarters of engineering backlog. |
| **Find threats hiding in app and business logs** | Detection and investigation reach beyond traditional security telemetry into custom application and business logs, surfacing fraud and abuse that no SIEM was watching. Engineers, not only analysts, can run it. |
| **Proactive anomaly detection at machine speed** | Source-agnostic behavioural baselining flags deviations with no known signature (impossible travel, off-hours access, first-seen processes, beaconing), catching novel and insider threats between analyst shifts. |
| **Lower cost than the legacy SIEM model** | The Singularity Data Lake keeps all data hot and searchable at flat-rate, indexless economics rather than per-gigabyte ingest pricing, and the bring-your-own-AI run cost is negligible against analyst hours and SIEM licensing. |

**Key metrics:** `< 5 min` mean investigation time · `100%` IOC enrichment coverage · `Real-time` MITRE ATT&CK mapping · `70%+` L1 capacity freed · `minutes` to onboard a new source · `hours` from emerging threat to live detection

---

### Setting up the PrincipalSOCAnalyst project

Install the stack using any of the three paths in [Installation](#installation) (the Docker quick start is the fastest). Then set up the project:

1. In Cowork, create a new project named `PrincipalSOCAnalyst` and select a folder for it.
2. Drop a copy of [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) into the folder. On the Docker path this is optional (the image ships a default persona); do it when you want to customise.
3. Confirm `s1-secops-skills` appears under Personal plugins and that `s1-secops-mcp`, `purple-mcp`, and your threat-intel MCP are green under MCP Servers.

**Start a session**

Open the **PrincipalSOCAnalyst** project and start a new chat. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` automatically and immediately runs:
- Data source enumeration: discovers every log source present in your SDL
- Alert triage: pulls open alerts in parallel while enumeration runs

> **Tip:** Keep a `reports/` subfolder inside your project folder. When Claude generates a SOC report, save it there so it persists across sessions.

---

### How to activate in other environments

**Claude Code (terminal)**
```bash
cd ~/path/to/ai-siem   # any folder containing CLAUDE.md
claude                        # CLAUDE.md is read automatically on startup
```

**Any Claude session**

Copy the contents of `CLAUDE.md` into Settings → Custom Instructions (or equivalent system prompt field) of any Claude session that has the plugin installed.

---

### What happens in a session

**Session initialisation (automatic, every session)**
1. Enumerates all live `dataSource.name` values in SDL, confirming which log sources are actually present and queryable
2. Runs alert triage in parallel, pulling open/critical alerts while enumeration executes
3. For any non-OCSF source discovered, runs schema discovery before writing any query

**Investigation workflow**
- Triage and context gathering: alert details, analyst notes, MDR verdicts, asset criticality
- Threat-intel enrichment: every IP, domain, hash, and URL enriched through the configured threat-intel MCP (VirusTotal in the default bundle) before any verdict; no finding classified CRITICAL without independent TI confirmation
- Infrastructure pivoting: C2 infrastructure, threat actor attribution, SSL certificate reuse, sibling domains, dropped payloads, execution chain reconstruction
- Cross-source correlation: IOC found in any source is immediately hunted across all other connected sources
- Anomaly analysis: every query result checked for frequency, timing, geolocation, baseline, volume, new entity, privilege, and chain anomalies
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping: every finding mapped to tactic and technique; kill chain gaps identified
- Composite risk scoring: cross-source anomaly scores determine escalation priority

**Report generation**

At the end of any significant investigation, ask Claude to produce a SOC report. It generates a structured `.docx` file containing: executive summary, incident timeline, affected assets, full IOC table with threat-intel verdicts, threat actor profile, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, root cause analysis, threat-intel summary, actions taken, and recommendations.

**Example session starters**
```
Start a new investigation session
```
```
Triage today's open alerts and flag anything requiring immediate action
```
```
Investigate alert ID <id>: full enrichment, verdict, and recommended response
```
```
Hunt for lateral movement across all connected sources in the last 24 hours
```
```
Write a SOC Leader report for this investigation as a Word document
```

## What you can do

These skills turn Claude into a hands-on SentinelOne analyst and engineer. Once the plugin is installed and credentials are configured, you can talk to your tenant in plain English. Claude handles the API calls, query writing, and JSON authoring and explains what it found or built.

**Threat hunting and investigation**: ask Claude to hunt for specific TTPs, IOCs, or behaviours across your SDL telemetry. It writes and runs PowerQuery automatically, pages through results, and summarises findings. You can go from a vague question ("any PowerShell reaching out to the internet?") to a ranked table of suspicious endpoints in one message.

**Alert and threat management**: list open threats, triage UAM alerts, add analyst notes, change status, or isolate an endpoint, all by describing what you want. Claude maps your intent to the right Management Console API calls and confirms what it did.

**Dashboard authoring**: describe the panels you want ("a SOC overview with threat timeline, top noisy endpoints, and outbound connection breakdown") and Claude produces deployment-ready SDL dashboard JSON, with queries validated against your tenant before it deploys.

**Log parser authoring**: paste a raw log sample and Claude writes a complete SDL parser definition, maps fields to OCSF, validates it against the parser engine, ingests a test event, and confirms the fields appear correctly, end to end in one session.

**Automation and response**: describe a response workflow in natural language ("when a high-severity alert fires on a server, isolate the endpoint, create an IOC for any hash in the alert, and notify the team") and Claude generates the Hyperautomation workflow JSON ready to import.

**Data lake operations**: ingest custom telemetry, list and manage configuration files, deploy or update parsers and dashboards, and run arbitrary queries through the SDL API.

**Behavioural baselining and anomaly detection**: build per-(principal, action) statistical baselines on any data source (Okta, FortiGate, CloudTrail, SentinelOne, Mimecast, Zeek, or anything else ingested into SDL) and surface deviations automatically. The skill auto-discovers the right principal field (user, host, IP, role) and action field (event.type, activity_name, action) per source so you don't hardcode field names. See [Behavioural baselining](#behavioural-baselining--anomaly-detection) below.

---

## Behavioural baselining + anomaly detection

A source-agnostic pipeline for building behavioural baselines and surfacing statistical anomalies
(SPIKE / DROP / SILENT / NEW-BEHAVIOR) on any log source ingested into SDL, baselined per
(principal, action) with day-of-week stratification and z-scoring. Run it interactively for a hunt,
or deploy it as a persisted baseline + scheduled rule + nightly refresh + dashboard.

Full guide, including the `baseline_anomaly.py` CLI, the three production failure modes it handles,
interactive and Cowork-chat usage, and productionising as a STAR / PowerQuery Alert rule, is in
[docs/solutions/ueba-anomaly-detection.md](./docs/solutions/ueba-anomaly-detection.md). PQ building
blocks are in `powerquery/examples/behavioral-baselines.md`.

### SDL solution deployment (sdl-solutions)

Whole solutions deployed into a customer site from one short prompt. The skill runs a short
parameter interview, previews the rendered config, then deploys and validates.

**Data source onboarding** (raw stream to OCSF, enrichment, dashboard, MITRE detections, threat-response flow). Full guide: [docs/solutions/data-source-onboarding.md](./docs/solutions/data-source-onboarding.md).

- *"Onboard the cisco_meraki logs on the Acme site"*
- *"Bring our new FortiGate firewall source into AI SIEM and build detections and a dashboard"*
- *"Set up detections and a dashboard for the Okta source on the Acme site"*
- *"Onboard our Zscaler logs end to end: OCSF parser, asset-enriched dashboard, MITRE-mapped detections, and a SOC threat-response playbook"*
- *"Onboard cisco_meraki and add the response automation that VirusTotal-checks the destination, then blocks the IOC and quarantines the source host on a malicious verdict"*

**UEBA behavioural anomaly detection** (baseline ANY signal, security or not, and flag z-score deviations: SPIKE, DROP, SILENT, NEW-BEHAVIOR). Full guide: [docs/solutions/ueba-anomaly-detection.md](./docs/solutions/ueba-anomaly-detection.md).

- *"Run a behavioural baseline on Okta and tell me what's anomalous"*
- *"Deploy UEBA anomaly detection for FortiGate on the Acme site"*
- *"Monitor the Avelios Medical app for unusual user behaviour"*

**Asset enrichment of raw logs** (device/user context from the Asset Inventory). Full guide: [docs/solutions/asset-enrichment.md](./docs/solutions/asset-enrichment.md).

- *"Deploy the asset enrichment solution for Acme on the Acme site"*
- *"Enrich the firewall logs with device and user info"*
- *"Add asset enrichment, query-time only, no parser"*

When you ask to add an enrichment, it is a single multi-select prompt: pick any of Device,
User/AD, Vulnerabilities, Misconfigurations, Open alerts, or Cloud context. Example:

- *"Add enrichment: device context and open vulnerabilities, keyed on hostname"*
- *"Enrich each event with user AD groups and privilege, and the device criticality"*

**Ingest health monitoring (per device)** (per-firewall/endpoint/server anomaly detection on a 7-day hour-of-day baseline: volume spike/drop, ingest lag, ingest loss, and parser drift, with email on every failure). Full guide: [docs/solutions/ingest-health-monitoring.md](./docs/solutions/ingest-health-monitoring.md).

- *"Deploy ingest health monitoring per device on the Acme site"*
- *"Monitor ingest per firewall and endpoint and email soc@acme.com on any failure"*
- *"Alert me when a specific firewall or endpoint stops sending logs"*

**Custom detection exclusions** (suppress known-good noise in a STAR rule, all three rule types: single-event and correlation rules with an inline hardcoded exclusion list, or a scheduled rule with a CSV lookup anti-join plus an effectiveness dashboard; the skill asks which rule type first). Full guide: [docs/solutions/custom-detection-exclusions.md](./docs/solutions/custom-detection-exclusions.md).

- *"Exclude my engineering team from the encoded-PowerShell detection"*
- *"Stop my Akamai DNS detection from alerting on our scanner subnets and corporate domains, here's the list"*
- *"Add a single-event STAR detection for encoded PowerShell that ignores our DevOps service accounts"*

**Risk-Based Alerting (RBA)** (publish noisy observations as low-noise risk events into a `risk` index, accumulate risk per user/host object amplified by asset risk factors, and fire one high-fidelity alert when a 24h cumulative-score or 7d multi-MITRE-tactic threshold is crossed). Full guide: [docs/solutions/risk-based-alerting.md](./docs/solutions/risk-based-alerting.md).

- *"Deploy risk-based alerting for users and hosts on the Acme site"*
- *"Set up RBA: score encoded PowerShell, recon, LOLBins, and log clearing, and alert when a user accumulates enough risk across tactics"*
- *"Roll out RBA with asset-criticality risk factors and a risk leaderboard dashboard"*

**Detection as Code (DaC)** (scaffold a Git + CI pipeline where detection engineers author rules as TOML, a pull request triggers validation and four-eyes review, and a merge syncs the changed rules to the Custom Detection Rule API; covers single-event, correlation, and scheduled rule types, with a zero-dependency TOML-to-API sync engine and CI for GitHub, GitLab, and Azure). Full guide: [docs/solutions/detection-as-code.md](./docs/solutions/detection-as-code.md).

- *"Set up detection as code for the Acme site"*
- *"Scaffold a DaC repo with GitHub Actions and sync the example rules"*
- *"Automate our detections as code: author in TOML, validate on PR, deploy on merge"*

For the full per-solution breakdown, outcomes, and more example prompts, see the solution skill's own README: [skills/sdl-solutions/README.md](./skills/sdl-solutions/README.md).

## Installation

Three ways to install. Pick one. All three end in the same place: the three MCP servers connected and the seven-skill plugin loaded in Claude Desktop.

| Path | Best for | Time |
|---|---|---|
| **[1. Quick start (Docker)](#1-quick-start-docker)** | Most users, including locked-down machines. One image, all three MCPs, no host Node/Python/uv. | ~10 min |
| **[2. Individual MCP / plugin / skill install](#2-individual-mcp--plugin--skill-install)** | You already run Node 18+ and want the MCPs on the host via `npx`/`uvx`, or you only want one skill. | ~10 min |
| **[3. Team VM install](#3-team-vm-install-shared-s1-secops-mcp)** | One shared `s1-secops-mcp` server for a whole team, with per-user tokens. | ~30 min |

Credentials are identical across all three paths. What each key is and where to get it: **[docs/credentials.md](./docs/credentials.md)**.

---

### 1. Quick start (Docker)

One image (`ghcr.io/pmoses-s1/s1-mcps`) bundles all three MCPs (`s1-secops-mcp`, `purple-mcp`, `virustotal-mcp`), version-locked together. You only need Docker installed: no host-level Node, Python, or `uv`. It works the same on macOS, Windows, and Linux, including machines where IT policy blocks `npm install -g` or `pip install`.

Prerequisite: Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or Docker Engine (Linux), running. Everything else is a credential (see the table in Step 2).

**Step 1: Pull the image (all three MCPs)**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/pmoses-s1/s1-mcps:1.3.3
```

`:1.3.3` is the current pinned release (bundles s1-secops-mcp 1.3.8, purple-mcp v0.7.0, virustotal-mcp 1.0.21). `:latest` also works; pin an explicit version for reproducible, forensically consistent installs. About 250 MB compressed.

**Step 2: Configure credentials**

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows). Paste the block below and replace every placeholder. All three MCPs reference the same image.

```json

Where to get each value:

| Placeholder | What it is | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| `S1_CONSOLE_URL` | Your console URL | e.g. `https://usea1-yourorg.sentinelone.net` |
| `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN` | Mgmt Console API token | Settings → Users → Service Users → Create New Service User ([guide](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000005291)) |
| `S1_HEC_INGEST_URL` | HEC ingest host for your region | [Endpoint URLs by Region](https://community.sentinelone.com/s/article/000004961) |
| `S1_HEC_TOKEN` | SDL Log Write Key. Optional, but **`hec_ingest` now needs it**: the event collector rejects the console API token, so raw log ingest fails without this key. | Console → Singularity Data Lake → API Keys → Log Write Key. No API mints one. |
| `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY` | VirusTotal API key (free tier is fine) | [virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/my-apikey) |

> **Optional, but raw log ingest now needs the SDL Log Write Key.** `hec_ingest` sends raw logs through the event collector, and the collector rejects the console API token: the same request returns `HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}` with a Log Write Key and `HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}` with the console token. So `S1_HEC_TOKEN` is the only credential that works for raw log ingest, and no other token substitutes for it. A key is minted for one account or site and writes only there, which also fixes the ingest destination. UAM alert ingest (`uam_ingest_alert`, `uam_post_alert`) and IOCs are unaffected and still use `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`. Omit `S1_HEC_TOKEN` only if you never ingest raw logs.

Full key reference, token types, and resolution order: **[docs/credentials.md](./docs/credentials.md)**. **Restart Claude Desktop** after saving.

**Step 3: Install the plugin (all eight skills)**

Download the latest plugin, [`s1-secops-skills-v1.3.6.plugin`](./dist/), from the `dist/` folder. In Claude Desktop: **Cowork → Customize → Browse plugins**, then upload the `.plugin` file. All eight skills install in one step.

Then create a Cowork project named `PrincipalSOCAnalyst` and select a folder for it. The Docker image ships a default CLAUDE.md, so dropping your own [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) into the folder is only needed if you want to customise the persona.

**Verify (tested)**

In the `PrincipalSOCAnalyst` project, start a session and run:

```
smoke test s1 secops skills
```

Claude checks all three MCPs, confirms each skill is loaded, and reports any missing credential or unreachable endpoint. You can also test the image straight from a terminal, no Claude Desktop required:

```bash
docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/pmoses-s1/s1-mcps:1.3.3 help    # lists the three bundled servers
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"0.1"}}}' \
  | docker run -i --rm ghcr.io/pmoses-s1/s1-mcps:1.3.3 s1-secops-mcp
```

The second command returns one JSON line with `serverInfo.name = "s1-secops-mcp-server"`, and stderr shows `Tools: 32 registered`.

**Troubleshooting**

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| MCP shows red in Cowork → MCP Servers | Confirm Docker is running: `docker info \| head -3`. Start Docker Desktop, then restart Claude Desktop. |
| `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` in the logs | Docker Desktop is not running. |
| `denied: permission_denied` from ghcr.io | Image is private or your network blocks ghcr.io: `docker login ghcr.io`, or check VPN/proxy. |
| `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY ... required`, or a `PURPLEMCP_*` validation error | The value did not reach the container. Check each `-e VAR` name has a matching key in the same block's `env`. |
| `S1 Mgmt API: NOT configured` | No console token reached the container; check `S1_CONSOLE_URL` + `S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`. |

Per-MCP logs are at `~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-<name>.log`. Upgrading from 1.2.x? See **[docs/upgrading.md](./docs/upgrading.md)**.

Full troubleshooting flowchart, hand-testing with credentials, and rollback: **[docs/docker.md](./docs/docker.md)**.

### 2. Individual MCP / plugin / skill install

Run the MCP servers directly on the host via `npx` (`s1-secops-mcp`, `virustotal`) and `uvx` (`purple-mcp`), with no Docker. Lighter on disk and slightly faster per session, but it needs Node 18+ and `uv`. Same steps, same credentials as above.

Full walkthrough (config block, prerequisites, project setup, upgrading): **[docs/installation.md](./docs/installation.md)**.

Only want one skill instead of the whole plugin? Each skill ships as a standalone `.skill` file in [`dist/`](./dist/); upload the individual file via Cowork → Customize → Browse plugins. The seven files are listed in [docs/installation.md](./docs/installation.md#step-2-install-the-plugin).

---

### 3. Team VM install (shared s1-secops-mcp)

Run one `s1-secops-mcp` instance on a shared VM for the whole team instead of installing per laptop. `s1-secops-mcp` v1.1.0+ supports this natively: a one-line installer, per-user bearer tokens (SIGHUP-reloadable), Caddy TLS, and an audit log of every user's tool calls.

Full walkthrough (install script, tokens, TLS, client config for Cowork/Claude Code and the Claude Desktop bridge, day-2 operations): **[docs/vm-deployment.md](./docs/vm-deployment.md)**.

---

### Upgrading

- **Docker**: bump the tag in `claude_desktop_config.json` (e.g. `:1.3.2` to `:1.3.3`) and restart Claude Desktop; the new image pulls on first launch.
- **npx/uvx**: automatic. `npx -y` and `uvx` re-resolve to the latest published version on each launch.
- **Plugin**: download the newer `.plugin` from [`dist/`](./dist/), then Cowork → Customize → Browse plugins, upload, and click **Replace**.
- **Team VM**: `git pull` on the VM and re-run the installer, or `npm i -g @pmoses-s1/s1-secops-mcp@latest`; see [docs/vm-deployment.md](./docs/vm-deployment.md).

## Windsurf

This repo includes Windsurf workflow files in `.windsurf/workflows/`. Each workflow is a thin pointer that directs Cascade to read the canonical `SKILL.md` and reference docs in the matching skill folder, with no duplicated content.

- `sentinelone-api.md`: Management Console API (agents, threats, alerts, sites, Purple AI, UAM).
- `powerquery.md`: PowerQuery authoring, debugging, and detection rules.
- `sdl-api.md`: Singularity Data Lake API (ingest, query, config files).
- `sdl-log-parser.md`: SDL log parser authoring with OCSF mapping.
