# Changelog

## 1.3.7

Minor, not patch: a tool is gone and the log-ingest credential changed. Both
break an existing caller, so the version says so.

### Log ingest needs an SDL Log Write Key

`hec_ingest` now authenticates with **`S1_HEC_TOKEN`**, an SDL Log Write Key,
and no longer sends an `S1-Scope` header. The Management Console API token is
refused by the event collector. Measured on a live tenant, same request, same
endpoint:

    write key      -> HTTP 200 {"text":"Success","code":0}
    console token  -> HTTP 400 {"text":"Missing S1-Scope header","code":5}

The key is minted per account or site and writes only there, so it fixes the
destination and there is nothing for a scope header to override. Mint it at
Console > Singularity Data Lake > API Keys > Log Write Key; no API creates one.
`S1_HEC_TOKEN` is optional, because only raw log ingest needs it, and it is named
to match the deployer repos so one value covers both.

UAM alert ingest and IOCs are NOT affected. They still use
`S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN`, and `/v1/alerts` still requires `S1-Scope`.

### Indicators ride inside the alert

**`uam_post_indicators` is removed** (32 tools -> 31). Indicators can no longer
be ingested on their own: `/v1/indicators` refuses the console user token and the
Log Write Key alike, so no credential can drive it. They now travel inline in
`finding_info.related_events[]` on a single `POST /v1/alerts`, which is also what
the console Indicators tab reads.

`uam_ingest_alert` posts once, inline. The `inline` parameter is still accepted
so existing callers do not crash, but it is forced to true and a false value
comes back with a note saying it was ignored, rather than quietly doing something
different. The old two-call flow, its ~3s sleep and its ordering contract are
deleted rather than left throwing: a code path that can only fail invites callers
to keep it alive.

Verified end to end on a live tenant: one alert carrying four indicators inline
in a single POST surfaced in UAM with all four rendered and every uid matching.

### Also

- `Indicator` in the UAM GraphQL schema has fields `type, uid, title,
  description, message, severity`. There is no `name` and no `category`;
  querying either returns `FieldUndefined`. Examples across the docs used them.
- `sdlToken`'s missing-credential test now runs in a child process. It deleted an
  env var, but credentials are resolved once at import and fall back to a file,
  so the exception it asserted could only be thrown on a machine with no
  credentials at all. It passed in CI for exactly that reason.

## 1.3.6 - 2026-08-17

Behaviour change, found by deploying to a real site and not being able to see the
result.

### Changed

- **`isPublic` / `public` now defaults to TRUE on dashboard creation** in both
  clients, where the raw `createDashboardV2` API defaults it to false.

  `access.owner` is set to the calling identity. With an API service-account
  token that is `serviceuser-<uuid>@mgmt-<n>.sentinelone.net`, not a person, so a
  private dashboard is readable through the API and **invisible in the console to
  the human operator at any scope**. That is indistinguishable from a failed
  deploy: the tool reports success, the object exists, and the user sees nothing.

  Verified live: the identical config at the identical site scope went from
  invisible to visible purely by recreating it with `public: true`, and every
  pre-existing dashboard at that site carried `public: true`.

  Pass `isPublic: false` / `public=False` deliberately for a dashboard that
  should stay private to the service account. `shareResource` to a scope does not
  flip `public`; the two are independent.

### Documented

- **Dashboard names reject punctuation, with only `Invalid name` as the error.**
  Probed one character class at a time against a live tenant:

  | Accepted | Rejected |
  |---|---|
  | letters, digits, space, `-`, `_`, `.`, `/` | `(` `)` `[` `]` `{` `}` `:` `,` `&` `'` `%` `#` |

  So `My Dashboard (prod)` fails with no indication of which character offended.
  Recorded in the tool description, both client docstrings,
  `sdl-api/references/config-file-graphql.md` and
  `sdl-dashboard/references/deployment.md`.

### Tests

115 JS (+1), 61 Python client (+2), 19 panel-safety. The two default-value
assertions were updated and paired with explicit-false cases, so an accidental
revert of the default fails the suite.

### Docker

Bundle image stays **1.3.2**; its npm pin moves to 1.3.6.

## 1.3.5 - 2026-08-17

Completes the scope work in 1.3.4. **Upgrade from 1.3.4 is recommended.**

### Fixed

- **Query methods ignored `scope`.** 1.3.4 added the `scope` argument to the
  config-file and dashboard operations but not to the query paths, even though
  log reads are filtered by the same `S1-Scope` header. A hunt or a
  panel-validation query run without the intended scope silently answered for
  the token default, which is the worst shape of this bug: a plausible number
  for the wrong boundary, with no error.

  Scope now threads through `lrqRun` (launch **and** poll, so the forward-tagged
  follow-ups stay on the same scope) and through all five Python query methods:
  `query`, `power_query`, `facet_query`, `numeric_query`, `timeseries_query`.
  Exposed on the `powerquery_run`, `powerquery_enumerate_sources` and
  `powerquery_schema_discover` tools.

  Found by using the shipped 1.3.4 client to discover schema at a site scope and
  getting `power_query() got an unexpected keyword argument 'scope'`.

- **`scopeHeaders` is now exported from `lib/sdl.js`** and imported by the LRQ
  path in `lib/s1.js`, rather than each surface resolving scope its own way. A
  second implementation would drift, and the validation rules (numeric ids,
  `null` suppresses the default) have to be identical on both.

### Tests

- 4 new JS cases: `v1Query` header presence and absence, malformed-scope
  rejection before any request, and a direct contract test on the exported
  `scopeHeaders`.
- 8 new Python cases covering all five query methods, unscoped omission,
  malformed-scope rejection, and `scope=None` suppression.
- Totals: 114 JS, 59 Python client, 19 panel-safety. No regressions.

### Docker

Bundle image stays **1.3.2**; its npm pin moves to 1.3.5.

## 1.3.4 - 2026-08-17

Adds site-level dashboard lifecycle. Two gaps closed: SDL GraphQL calls never
sent an `S1-Scope` header, and the dashboard operations the console itself uses
were not wrapped at all. **26 tools → 32.**

### Added

- **`S1-Scope` on every SDL GraphQL and V1-query call.** Optional `scope`
  argument on `configFiles`, `configFile`, `putConfigFile`, `deleteConfigFile`
  and `v1Query`, and on the four `sdl_*_file` tools. Falls back to a new
  `S1_SCOPE` credential; `scope: null` suppresses that default and sends no
  header. Format `"<accountId>"` or `"<accountId>:<siteId>"`, validated before
  the request so a typo cannot silently widen the read.
- **Six dashboard-lifecycle tools** on the `dashboardsV2` surface:
  `sdl_list_dashboards`, `sdl_get_dashboard`, `sdl_create_dashboard`,
  `sdl_share_dashboard`, `sdl_save_dashboard_layout`, `sdl_delete_dashboard`.
- **`sdl_create_dashboard`** takes the whole dashboard document as one `config`
  string, the path the console uses. It parses the JSON first, so the UI
  stub-append failure (`{graphs: []}{...}` → "Content is invalid json /
  Additional text after JSON object", leaving an empty dashboard behind) is
  reported as a caller error instead of filing a broken shell.
- **`sdl_share_dashboard`** wraps `shareResource`, the only SDL operation that
  takes an explicit scope target. This is how an account-scoped dashboard is
  pushed to a site without recreating it. Scope targets are validated up front,
  because the server accepts a malformed entry, shares nothing, and reports
  success.
- **`S1_SCOPE`** added to `getCreds()`. It was absent, so any credentials-file
  default would have been read and then dropped.

### Fixed

- **Scope-sensitive call sites now scope consistently.** Absence
  disambiguation re-lists at the scope of the failed lookup, the `/dashboards/`
  duplicate guard lists at the scope of the write, and delete verification
  re-reads at the scope of the delete. Mixing scopes across these steps reports
  a live site-scoped file as deleted, which is the same false-negative class
  1.3.3 fixed for error text.

### Corrected documentation

- `sdl-api/references/config-file-graphql.md` claimed the `s1-scope` header was
  "ignored, not rejected" on `/sdl/v2/graphql`. **That was wrong.** Measured on
  `<console>`, same token and query: `configFiles` returned 113 files at
  account scope and 4 at a site scope. Config listings and dashboard reads are
  scope-FILTERED, so a dropped header changes which objects appear to exist.
  `auth_and_limits.md` corrected to match.

### Dashboard skill

- **`site.id`, not `site.name`, is the scoping predicate.** For one site over
  24h, `site.id='<id>'` matched 60,410 events of which 510 carried the site id
  with a null `site.name`: `ActivityFeed` 172, `asset` 111, unattributed 99,
  `SentinelOne` 70, `Windows Event Logs` 48, `alert` 10. A `site.name` filter
  silently drops alert and asset records. `site.id` is also the same value as
  the `S1-Scope` `siteId` and survives a site rename.
- **New scope doctrine in `sdl-dashboard/SKILL.md`:** deployment scope and query
  scope are separate decisions, and a site-deployed dashboard scopes its panels
  to that site unless the user explicitly asks for account-wide queries.
- **`panel_safety_check.py --site-id <id>`** adds rule **S01** (query panel with
  no, or wrong, `site.id` predicate on a site-targeted dashboard; opt out with
  `--allow-account-scope-queries`) and rule **S02** (`site.name` used as a
  scoping filter; never suppressed, the substitution is wrong at any scope).
- Recorded that the console's XDR selector injects
  `preFilter: "dataSource.category = 'security'"` into every panel query.

### Python client (`sdl-api/scripts/sdl_client.py`)

- Per-call `scope` on `config_files`, `config_file`, `put_config_file`,
  `delete_config_file`, with the same `_UNSET`-vs-`None` distinction.
- Six new methods mirroring the JS layer: `list_dashboards`, `get_dashboard`,
  `create_dashboard`, `share_dashboard`, `save_dashboard_layout`,
  `delete_dashboard`.
- `get_dashboard` treats both a null result and a GraphQL error as absence,
  disambiguated against the listing. Assuming only the null form is what broke
  every delete in 1.3.2; the confirming re-read threw on the success path.

### Tests

- 24 new cases in `tests/sdl-graphql.test.mjs`: header presence and absence,
  credentials fallback, `scope: null` suppression, malformed-scope rejection
  before any request, scope consistency across the guard / disambiguation /
  delete-verify paths, the six dashboard operations, stub-append rejection, and
  the `getDashboard` absence matrix.
- New `sdl-dashboard/tests/test_panel_safety_check.py`: 19 cases over S01 and
  S02 including the wrong-site case, the opt-out flag, exempt panel types, and
  a regression guard that existing rules still fire.
- Tool-count assertions updated 26 → 32 across the smoke, stdio, HTTP and
  origin-guard suites.

## 1.3.3 - 2026-08-07

Fixes a user-facing regression in 1.3.2 found by running the live MCP tools
against a tenant for the first time. **Upgrade from 1.3.2 is recommended.**

### Fixed

- **Every successful `sdl_delete_file` reported an error in 1.3.2.** The delete
  verification added in 1.3.2 re-reads the file to confirm removal, but the server
  reports absence as a GraphQL error rather than a null result, so the confirming
  read threw on exactly the success path. The delete itself always worked; only the
  reported outcome was wrong. Verified live: three deletes across `/dashboards/`,
  `/datatables/` and `/logParsers/` all removed their file and all three surfaced
  as errors.
- **`sdl_get_file` on a missing path returned a raw GraphQL error** instead of the
  actionable "this may be udoId-addressed, list it and retry" hint. The hint branch
  was unreachable because the library threw before returning.
- **Absence is now detected reliably on both address forms.** The error text differs:
  a missing name gives "Config file with name X not found.", a missing `udoId` gives
  the generic "Something went wrong. Please try again...", which is also what a
  version conflict returns. `configFile` normalises the explicit form and
  disambiguates the generic one against the file listing, so a deleted dashboard
  reads as absent while a genuine server error still propagates.
- **An out-of-range numeric `udoId` is no longer swallowed by the absence path.**
  Validation now runs before the lookup, so a caller bug surfaces as a caller bug.
- **A transport error is never read as "file absent".** Absence detection now requires a
  GraphQL-layer error, so a 404 page or WAF block whose body contains the words "not found"
  no longer satisfies it. Without this a delete could confirm itself against a file it
  never checked.
- **A failing listing during absence disambiguation keeps the original error** instead of
  replacing it with the listing failure.
- **The duplicate guard is no longer bypassed by case.** Its namespace test was
  case-sensitive while its name comparison was not, so `/Dashboards/AI Usage` skipped the
  guard entirely. Both now share one normaliser.
- **`v1Query` keeps its backoff.** Restricting status retry to idempotent methods removed it
  from this read-only POST, which schema discovery iterates once per data source.

### Python client (`sdl-api/scripts/sdl_client.py`)

Brought to parity with the JS client:

- Status retry is restricted to idempotent methods. The Python client was retrying POST
  mutations, which is the mechanism that duplicates a dashboard on a re-sent write.
- `Retry-After` is capped at 30s; an unbounded value parked the process.
- The duplicate guard fails closed on an empty listing.
- Absence detection, name normalisation and delete verification match the JS behaviour.

### Tests

- `tests/sdl-graphql.test.mjs`: 86 cases, adding the transport-error-is-not-absence case,
  listing-failure error preservation, the case-variant guard bypass, and `v1Query` retry.
- `sdl-api/tests/test_client.py`: new. 19 cases over a stubbed session, so the Python client
  is no longer invisible to CI. Runs in ~0.01s with no network.
- Live regression through the real MCP stdio protocol: handshake, 26 tools, and full
  create/read/update/stale-reject/delete/confirm-absent cycles for `/datatables/` and
  `/dashboards/`, plus the duplicate guard, the notFound hint, and `/automaticLookups`.

## 1.3.2 - 2026-08-07

Config-file operations move from the legacy REST endpoints to GraphQL. Tool count unchanged at
26, and all four tool names are unchanged, so no caller needs to change.

### Fixed

- **`sdl_list_files` no longer returns an incomplete listing.** The REST `/sdl/api/listFiles`
  endpoint omits every udoId-addressed dashboard. Measured live on `<console>`: REST returned
  1,914 paths against `configFiles`' 2,264, a 350-file gap consisting entirely of `/dashboards/`
  files that carry a `udoId`. REST `getFile` on any of them returns `success/noSuchFile`. The
  practical impact was a false negative: a dashboard that existed in the console was reported as
  not found. All four config-file tools now run on `POST /sdl/v2/graphql`.
- **`sdl_list_files` description no longer claims to return "all" files.** It did not, and the
  claim was load-bearing: an agent reading it had no reason to look further after an empty result.
- **`sdl_get_file` / `sdl_put_file` / `sdl_delete_file` can now address dashboards.** New `udoId`
  parameter. The console's Configuration Files grid displays a dashboard as
  `/dashboards/id/<udoId>/<name>`; that string is not a path, and reading it as one returns
  `no file exists at path`.

### Added

- **`lib/sdl.js`: `configFiles`, `configFile`, `putConfigFile`, `deleteConfigFile`** over
  `POST /sdl/v2/graphql`. GraphQL reports failure as HTTP 200 with an `errors` array, so the
  wrapper raises on that array rather than trusting the status code.
- **Duplicate guardrail on dashboard writes.** `addConfigFile(name:)` updates in place for a
  name-addressed file but creates a duplicate for a dashboard (both verified live). `sdl_put_file`
  now refuses a name-addressed write to an *existing* dashboard and names the `udoId`s already
  holding it, while still allowing the initial create, which has no `udoId` yet. The tenant this
  was found on already carries 256 surplus dashboard copies from this behaviour, including 152 of
  `/dashboards/AI Usage`.
- **`pathPrefix` filter on `sdl_list_files`**, so callers can scope to `/dashboards/` or
  `/logParsers/` without pulling the full listing into context.

### Notes

- `udoId` is assigned by namespace, verified live: only `/dashboards/` files get one. `/lookups/`,
  `/datatables/`, `/logParsers/` and `/automaticLookups` are name-addressed with `udoId` null.
- `expectedVersion` is enforced on both address forms. A stale value is rejected with
  "There are conflicting changes in the file." and the stored content is left untouched.
- A `deleteConfigFile` returning `null` with no `errors` array is success, not failure.
- The scoped SDL keys (`SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY` and friends) are retired; the console API token
  covers every SDL operation.

## 1.2.4 - 2026-07-31

Hardening release from the 2026-07-31 code review. Tool count unchanged at 26.

### Fixed

- **Missing `Retry-After` header no longer sleeps 0ms before retrying.** `Number(null)` is 0, so `lib/s1.js`, `lib/hec.js`, and `lib/uam-ingest.js` treated an absent header as "wait 0ms" and hammered the backend. All three now use the validated pattern from `lib/sdl.js`: honor the header only when present and parseable as a finite number of seconds (capped at 30s), otherwise fall back to the exponential delay. Numeric headers behave exactly as before.
- **`uam_set_status` no longer reports silent success.** The `alertTriggerActions` mutation selected only `__typename`, so a skipped or failed action still returned as if it worked (observed live: status unchanged after a "successful" call). The selection now mirrors the full `actions { success failure skip }` shape and the client throws when the backend reports a failure entry, skips the action without a success, or returns an empty actions list (nothing applied, e.g. the filter matched no alert). `uam_add_note` was audited for the same pattern; it already verifies via the returned note list.
- **LRQ polling tolerates transient poll errors.** A single 429/5xx poll response used to throw and cancel the running query. Transient statuses now keep polling (interval doubles up to 5s) until the existing 5-minute deadline; other 4xx responses remain fatal.
- **`hasSdlCreds()` recognizes read-only key deployments.** It required `SDL_CONFIG_WRITE_KEY` or the console token; tenants configured with only `SDL_LOG_READ_KEY` / `SDL_CONFIG_READ_KEY` were reported as unconfigured. All chain keys now count.
- **HTTP transport: oversized bodies get their 413.** The request was destroyed before the response was written, so clients saw a connection reset instead of the 413 JSON error. The server now stops reading, sends the 413, then drops the connection after the response is flushed.
- **HTTP transport exits nonzero on any listen-time server error** (EACCES, EADDRNOTAVAIL, ...), not only EADDRINUSE, so systemd/Docker restart policies see the failure.
- **`powerquery_schema_discover` escapes backslashes before quotes** in the data-source name; quote-only escaping let a trailing backslash re-open the V1 filter string.
- **`s1_api_get` honors an inline `?isLegacy=` already present in the path** instead of appending a conflicting `isLegacy=false` query param, matching `_maybe_inject_islegacy` in the Python twin.
- **SDL `config_read` key chain reordered to least-privilege first** (config_read, config_write, console JWT), matching the Python `SDLClient` the header claims to mirror.

### Changed

- **Removed dead exports `purpleAiQuery` and `purpleAiInvestigate`** from `lib/s1.js`; their MCP tools were removed 2026-05-03 (browser-session teamToken requirement) and nothing referenced the library functions. Corrected stale doc text that pointed at a nonexistent `uam_set_analyst_verdict` tool: the analyst verdict is set via a raw `alertTriggerActions` mutation with the `analystVerdictUpdate` action through `s1_api_post`.
- **Deploy docs: credentials.json changes require `systemctl restart`.** SIGHUP reload only re-reads bearer tokens; the installer output and systemd unit comment said reload was enough. `deploy/install.sh` also sets `umask 077` so token/credential files are never world-readable at creation (the explicit `chmod 600` lines remain).
- **Claude Desktop bridge hardening:** 120s fetch timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout`), notification responses are drained so keep-alive sockets are released, and the URL constant no longer shadows the global `URL` constructor.
- **Docker entrypoint passes extra args through** to the selected server binary (e.g. `s1-secops-mcp --transport http`); no-args behavior is unchanged.
- **`const status = response.error ? 200 : 200`** simplified; JSON-RPC errors still return HTTP 200 with an error envelope.

### Tests

- New `tests/regressions-2026-07-31.test.mjs` (mocked fetch, no network): missing `Retry-After` uses the exponential delay, `uamSetStatus` throws on failure/skip results, inline `?isLegacy=` is honored. Both regression suites are now part of `npm test`.
- Transport and smoke tests read the expected version from `package.json` instead of a hardcoded string.

## 1.2.3 - 2026-07-29

Correctness release from the 2026-07-29 defect review. Fixes two bugs that produced plausible-but-wrong query results, hardens the SDL auth chain and HTTP retry paths, corrects the HEC `/event` content type, and adds a regression suite. Tool count unchanged at 26. (The Docker bundle image moved to 1.2.4 pinning `S1_MCP_VERSION=1.2.3`; the image tag stays ahead of the npm tag as it has since the split.)

### Fixed

- **`powerquery_run` no longer collapses a caller-supplied time window.** The old code overwrote BOTH `startTime` and `endTime` with the last-`hours` default whenever either was missing, so a startTime-only call silently ran over the last 24 hours. Each bound now defaults independently. Live A/B: a startTime-only 7.4-day query returned 73,755 events on the fixed server vs 12,911 (the 24h control) on the old one.
- **`powerquery_run` now reports `matchCount`.** It was read from the top level of the LRQ response and came back `null` on every call; it lives inside the `data` block on current engines.
- **SDL auth chain falls through on 401/403.** `lib/sdl.js` treated an auth failure on the first configured key as fatal even when a later key (e.g. the console JWT) would work. It now advances through the chain and raises only when exhausted.
- **HEC `/event` ingestion uses `application/json`,** so per-event `time` backdating is honored instead of the envelope being indexed as opaque text at receive time.

### Changed

- **Write requests no longer auto-retry on 5xx.** Retry is restricted to idempotent methods (GET/HEAD); read-only POSTs (GraphQL queries, Purple AI launches) opt back in via `allowRetry`. HEC raw ingest no longer retries 5xx (no idempotency key); UAM ingest still retries because `metadata.uid` dedupes.
- **`Retry-After` parsing hardened:** an HTTP-date value no longer collapses to `sleep(NaN)`; waits are validated and capped at 30s.
- **`uam_add_note` returns the correct note** (matches by text, tiebreaks on newest `createdAt`) instead of assuming newest-last ordering.
- **`uam_post_alert` schema help corrected** to require `class_uid 99602001` (the S1 Security Alert extension class); generic OCSF `2002` is silently dropped by the stitcher.
- **`ha_export_workflow` no longer implies it returns the archive** (metadata only).
- **`powerquery_schema_discover` escapes single quotes** in the data-source name before building the V1 filter.

### Tests

- New `tests/regressions-2026-07-29.test.mjs` (mocked fetch, no network): independent time-bound defaults, `matchCount` extraction, SDL 401/403 fall-through, HEC per-endpoint content type, write-vs-read retry semantics.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-06-13

### Changed

- **Renamed `ha_archive_workflow` to `ha_delete_workflow`.** The old tool hit `POST /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/archive`, which returns HTTP 500 on this tenant. The replacement uses the validated `DELETE /hyper-automate/api/v1/workflows/{id}` endpoint (a soft, recoverable delete equivalent to clicking Delete in the Hyperautomation UI). Scope the call with `accountIds` or `siteIds`; a 404 "Object not found" means the id is not under that scope or is already deleted. Updated `README.md`, the tools-table regenerator, and the smoke test in lockstep.
- **`powerquery_run` description now documents the `datasource` and `savelookup` capabilities** (querying SentinelOne-managed inventory such as assets/alerts/vulnerabilities/misconfigurations, and persisting a result as a reusable lookup table), pointing at the new `powerquery/references/datasource-command.md`.

### Notes

- Tool count unchanged at 26 (the Hyperautomation tool was renamed, not added or removed).
- `SERVER_INFO.version` bumped in lockstep with `package.json` (the drift that forced the 1.2.0 -> 1.2.1 re-release).

## 1.2.1 - 2026-06-11

Supersedes 1.2.0, which was deprecated on npm. The 1.2.0 build shipped with a stale internal `SERVER_INFO.version` of `1.1.0` despite a `1.2.0` package version, so the server announced the wrong version on `initialize`. 1.2.1 is identical in features and corrects the reported runtime version. The content below is unchanged from the 1.2.0 work.

### Added

- **`hec_ingest` tool**: raw-log/event ingestion into the Singularity Data Lake via the HEC (HTTP Event Collector) endpoint (`/services/collector/raw` and `/services/collector/event`). Supports `parser` (-> `?sourcetype=`), custom `fields` (query params), **required** `scope` (S1-Scope header), gzip compression, and `isParsed` (-> `?isParsed=true`, indexes already-structured JSON with no SDL parser). Replaces the removed `sdl_upload_logs`. Validated live across the full HEC matrix (both endpoints, gzip on/off, parser field extraction, multi-line, batched, reserved-field handling, scope enforcement, isParsed). Grounded in the S-26.1 HEC docs (p.4723-4726).

### Removed

- **`sdl_upload_logs` tool** plus the underlying SDL `uploadLogs`/`addEvents` library functions and `SDL_LOG_WRITE_KEY` plumbing. SDL raw-log ingestion moves to the HEC path (`hec_ingest`). The `sdl-api` skill is now query + configuration only; the `sdl-log-parser` validation loop uses HEC ingest.

### Changed

- Tool count unchanged at 26 (removed `sdl_upload_logs`, added `hec_ingest`).
- Skill docs corrected: scheduled detection rules bind the Target Asset via `entityMappings` ("Entity column mapping"); the full scheduled-rule option set (UI <-> API) is catalogued in `powerquery/references/detection-rules.md`.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-05-28 (rebuilt 2026-05-31)

### Fixed (rebuild)

- **`s1_api_get` now auto-injects `isLegacy=false` for `/cloud-detection/rules` listings.** Without `isLegacy=false` the S1 API silently omits `queryType="scheduled"` PowerQuery rules from the response; no error, no warning, the response just lies by omission. The handler now guards against this when the caller forgets, and the tool description loudly flags the requirement. This eliminates the "I see zero scheduled detections" failure mode that was producing wrong verdicts when listing Custom Detection rules. Same `1.1.0` version per the rebuild request.

### Added

- **Streamable HTTP transport.** New `--transport http` mode (default stays `stdio`). Single-endpoint POST `/mcp` per the MCP 2024-11-05 spec, plus `/healthz` for load balancer probes. Implementation is pure `node:http`, no new dependencies.
- **Per-user bearer token auth.** New `MCP_BEARER_TOKENS_FILE` env var pointing at a `{ "<name>": "<token>" }` JSON file gives each team member a stable name in audit logs and supports rotation. SIGHUP reloads tokens without dropping connections. `MCP_BEARER_TOKENS` env var (comma-separated raw tokens) is a fallback for small or quick-test setups.
- **Audit logging.** Every authenticated HTTP request emits `[audit] <ts> | <name> | <method> | <param-summary> | <status>` to stderr; systemd captures it via journald.
- **`S1_CREDS_FILE` credential resolver.** Highest-priority explicit path for credentials, useful for VM deployments and secret-store integrations (Vault, Doppler, 1Password Connect, sealed-secrets).
- **Deploy artifacts** under `deploy/`:
  - `install.sh`: one-shot installer for Mac and Linux. `--user` mode for individuals, `--server` mode for Linux VMs (creates `mcp` system user, generates an initial bearer token, installs systemd unit, starts the service).
  - `systemd/s1-secops-mcp.service`: hardened unit with `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `MemoryDenyWriteExecute`, SIGHUP-as-reload.
  - `caddy/Caddyfile.example`: TLS reverse proxy template with bearer header gate and streaming-friendly flush.
  - `README.md`: full topology guide (single-user local, single-user HTTP, team VM-hosted) with day-2 operations.
- **Test suite.** Three new files under `tests/`, runnable via `npm test`:
  - `smoke.test.mjs`: source-of-truth tool inventory (26 tools by name).
  - `stdio-transport.test.mjs`: JSON-RPC round trip via spawned stdio process.
  - `http-transport.test.mjs`: HTTP transport end-to-end, bearer auth happy/sad paths.
- **README auto-regenerator** at `scripts/regen-readme-tools-table.mjs`. `npm run regen:readme` keeps the README table in sync with `ALL_TOOLS`. `npm run regen:readme -- --check` fails when stale (suitable for CI).

### Fixed

- **README tool table.** Previous count was 19; actual is 26. Auto-generated now.
- **Header comment in `index.js`.** Previously said 21; updated to 26.
- **`purple_ai_query`** removed from the documentation. The tool itself was removed 2026-05-03 because the underlying API requires a browser-session `teamToken` that service-account API tokens never obtain. The README, `index.js`, and `docs/mcp-tools.md` no longer reference it.
- **`uam_set_status` documentation.** Doc previously said valid status values include `CLOSED`. The source enum is `NEW`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `RESOLVED`; doc now matches.

### Changed

- **Refactored** dispatch out of `index.js` into `lib/server-core.js` so both transports use one code path. `lib/stdio-transport.js` is the extracted stdio loop; `lib/http-transport.js` is new.
- **package.json**:
  - `version` 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
  - new scripts: `start:http`, `test`, `regen:readme`
  - new files included in the npm tarball: `deploy/`, `scripts/`, `CHANGELOG.md`

### Compatibility

- Default invocation is unchanged: `npx -y @pmoses-s1/s1-secops-mcp` still produces a stdio MCP server with identical behaviour to 1.0.0.
- Existing `claude_desktop_config.json` and `.mcp.json` configs work without modification.
- The 26 tools, 2 resources, and 2 prompts are unchanged from the late-1.0.0 line; only the documentation now matches reality.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-05-07

Initial public release.

- 19 tools across PowerQuery, S1 Mgmt REST, UAM, SDL API, Hyperautomation.
- stdio transport only.
- Credentials via env vars or auto-discovered `credentials.json`.
