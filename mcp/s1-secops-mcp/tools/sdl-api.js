/**
 * SDL API tools: sdl-api, sdl-dashboard, sdl-log-parser skills
 *
 * Config-file tools (raw SDL config layer):
 *   sdl_list_files            List every config file visible at a scope
 *   sdl_get_file              Get file content and version, by path or udoId
 *   sdl_put_file              Deploy or update a config file (optimistic locking)
 *   sdl_delete_file           Delete a config file
 *
 * Dashboard lifecycle tools (dashboardsV2, the console's own surface):
 *   sdl_list_dashboards       List dashboards with owner and sharing metadata
 *   sdl_get_dashboard         Read one dashboard including its tabs
 *   sdl_create_dashboard      Create from a full dashboard-JSON config
 *   sdl_share_dashboard       Share to a site / account / global scope
 *   sdl_save_dashboard_layout Replace the panel layout of one tab
 *   sdl_delete_dashboard      Delete a dashboard
 *
 * Ingest:
 *   hec_ingest                Ingest raw logs/events into SDL via HEC
 *
 * Everything except hec_ingest runs on `POST /sdl/v2/graphql`. The legacy REST
 * `/sdl/api/*File` endpoints are NOT used: they silently omit every
 * udoId-addressed dashboard (1,914 vs 2,264 files on a live tenant) and return
 * `success/noSuchFile` for any of them.
