/**
 * UAM Alert Interface tools: push OCSF indicators + alerts INTO UAM
 * via the SentinelOne HEC ingest host (ingest.us1.sentinelone.net).
 *
 * Tools:
 *   uam_ingest_alert      End-to-end: build + POST one SecurityAlert carrying its indicator inline
 *   uam_post_alert        Low-level: POST a single raw OCSF SecurityAlert to /v1/alerts
 *
 * uam_post_indicators WAS REMOVED. Indicators can no longer be ingested on their
 * own: /v1/indicators refuses the console user token and the SDL Log Write Key
 * alike, so no credential can drive it. They are carried inside the alert, in
 * finding_info.related_events[], which is also what the console Indicators tab
 * reads. A tool that can only ever return 403 is worse than no tool, because it
 * reads as a supported path.
 *
 * These tools require S1_HEC_INGEST_URL plus S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN. Alert creation
 * and IOCs remain user-token operations; only raw LOG ingest over the event
 * collector uses S1_HEC_TOKEN.

    description: `Create a synthetic test alert in Unified Alert Management (UAM) via the SentinelOne ingest API.

ONE round-trip: a single SecurityAlert POSTed to /v1/alerts with its indicator embedded in finding_info.related_events[]. No sleep, no stitcher race, no ordering contract. That inline copy is what populates alert.indicators, the field the console Indicators tab renders.

There is no longer a two-call alternative. Posting indicators separately to /v1/indicators is refused for every credential type: the console user token and the SDL Log Write Key both fail, so nothing can drive that endpoint. The old flow also wrote alert.rawIndicators, a separate store the UI never read. The inline parameter is still accepted so existing callers do not break, but it is forced to true.

Returns indicator_uid and alert_uid. The alert surfaces in UAM within 30-60s. Verify with alert(id){indicators{...}}; alertWithRawIndicators stays empty by design. Requires S1_HEC_INGEST_URL and S1_CONSOLE_API_TOKEN.`,
